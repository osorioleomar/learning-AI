Our project portfolio contains both small molecules that are orally active immunomodulatory agents and antibody based immunotherapy. Laquinimod, licensed to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., is in clinical Phase II development for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, a rare neuro­ degenerative disease with a high medical need. ANYARA, licensed to NeoTX Therapeutics Ltd., is being developed to treat solid tumors. In addition, activities are conducted to identify strategic and competent partners for ensuring the continued development of tasquinimod in multiple myeloma, paquinimod for systemic sclerosis and the early preclinical projects in the SILC program. Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulatory investi- gational drug with a novel mechanism of action, preventing neurodegeneration and inflammation in the central nervous system. Laquinimod is being developed for daily treatment of Huntington’s disease, a rare neurodegenerative disease. Currently, a Phase II study in Huntington’s disease is ongoing with results expected in second half of 2018. Laquinimod has been granted orphan drug designation for this indication by the FDA, which provides for seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Active Biotech has an agreement with the Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd since 2004 covering the worldwide development and commerciali- zation of laquinimod. ANYARA is a tumor-targeting immunotherapy that enhances the ability of the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. Active Biotech has an agreement with NeoTX Therapeutics Ltd since October 2016 for the global development and commercialization of ANYARA for the treatment of cancer. trial of ANYARA combined with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced cancer. Preparations are in progress to commence a clinical Tasquinimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulatory compound that reduces a tumor’s ability to grow and spread. Tasquinimod is being developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a rare form of blood cancer with a high medical need. Patents in key markets have been granted, providing protection for the use of tasquinimod in malignant blood disorders, specifically acute forms of leukemia and multiple myeloma, until 2035. Further- more, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for tasquinimod for the treatment of multiple myeloma, which provides for seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Tasquinimod shows compelling data in experimental models of multiple myeloma and the next step is to confirm proof of concept in a clinical Phase I/II study. Active Biotech is now seeking a collaboration partner for the further development of tasquinimod. S100A9 is expressed in the tumor microenvironment SILC (S100A9 Inhibition by Low molecular weight Compounds) is a preclinical immuno-oncology project focused on S100A9 as the target molecule for the treat- ment of cancer. and is involved in the development of cancer through recruitment and activation of specific immune cells that counteract the T cells’ ability to attack and eradicate the tumor. S100A9 is also involved in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches and in the formation of new blood vessels, which provide nutrition and oxygen into the growing tumor. Small substances that block the function of S100A9 could represent a new therapeutic alternative to help the body’s own immune system fight cancer. Chemical libraries of substances have been screened for binding to this target molecule and lead substances with good properties for further development have been identified. Three international patent applications have been filed for the purpose of obtaining patent protection for three, chemically unrelated, substance groups, and patents from two patent families have been granted to date in Europe and the US. Active Biotech is seeking a collaboration partner for the further development of the project. Paquinimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulatory Paquinimod shows potent effects on fibrosis and compound in development for treatment of systemic sclerosis, a rare autoimmune disease of the connective tissue with a high unmet medical need. inflammation in several experimental models of systemic sclerosis and has been granted orphan drug designation in both the EU and the US, which provides for ten and seven years, respectively, of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Active Biotech is seeking a collaboration partner with expertise to further develop paquinimod in systemic sclerosis. ●●●● 4 C O M M E N T S F R O M T H E C E O 2017 Comments from the CEO 2017 was a challenging year of negative events in the MS project with laquinimod. At the same time, I am pleased with what we have achieved in other projects where important interim goals for continued development have been achieved. 2017 was the year that we were looking forward to positive results with laquinimod from the two ongoing MS studies. To our disappointment and that of many others, these expectations were not realized. We announced with our partner Teva in May that the primary endpoint in the CONCERTO study in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) – reducing disability progression in patients measured by EDSS – had not been met. This was a regrettable result that was crucial to the further development of laquinimod in MS. The results from the ARPEGGIO Phase II study of laquinimod in primary progressive MS (PPMS) were announced in December. The study did not show any difference for the primary endpoint of brain atrophy between the group that received laquinimod treatment and the group given a placebo. Accordingly, the results could not justify continued clinical development of laquini mod in PPMS. All in all, this meant that following a comprehensive program TEVA ended the development of laquinimod in MS. However, the clinical development of laquinimod in Huntington’s disease will continue and the Phase II study of LEGATO­HD is progressing according to plan with results expected in the autumn of 2018. During the year, we demonstrated together with NeoTX, our partner for ANYARA, that the combination of ANYARA and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, for example, Keytruda, generated clear additional effects in preclinical tumor models. These results support both new patent applications and the future clinical develop­ ment of ANYARA. Preparations are now being made to commence a clinical study in ANYARA toward the end of 2018. In our other projects, we pursued commercial and value­creating activities in 2017 to support continued development and partnership agreements. Financing In February 2018, the Board of Directors decided to imple- ment a new rights issue of approximately SEK 48 million before issue costs. The rights issue is being conducted to ensure financial sustainability in order to await the outcome of clinical studies and to conduct negotiations with partners around the projects. The rights issue was over subscribed by approximately 30 percent and provides the company with approximately SEK 48 million before issue expenses. The company’s existing cash and cash equivalents and liquidity supplement from the ongoing sale of the company’s property are expec- ted to finance operations according to the current business plan. Laquinimod The CONCERTO study was designed based on the results of the two previously conducted Phase III studies, ALLEGRO and BRAVO in RRMS. In these studies, laquinimod displayed an explicit effect on slowing disability progression (Confirmed Disease Progression, CDP) when assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Being able to evaluate the effect as a primary endpoint in a major study was attractive since it could give laquinimod advantages in the market compared with registered therapies. Contrary to previous studies, the results of CONCERTO showed no effect on CDP, although the secondary relapse- related endpoints and MRI parameters were met in line with previous studies. Following extensive analysis of the study data from all Phase III trials, there is still no full explanation for the results of the CONCERTO study. In general, it can be said that CDP is a challenging clinical endpoint since relatively few such events are normally achieved during a limited study period, which could have contributed to the lack of effect on the primary results of the study. With patents secured in key markets and orphan drug status granted for tasquinimod in multiple myeloma, we have created highly favorable conditions for the continued advancement of tasquinimod. 5 C O M M E N T S F R O M T H E C E O The ARPEGGIO Phase II study was a proof of concept study, whose primary aim was to show the therapeutic benefit of laquinimod in patients with PPMS. The primary endpoint, brain atrophy, as defined by percent brain volume change from baseline to week 48, was not met in the study. The time to CDP, a secondary endpoint, was also not met. The study results were deemed not to justify continued development of laquinimod in PPMS. Ultimately, this meant that Teva will not continue the development of laquinimod in MS. This decision is naturally a disappoint- ment after extensive clinical development in MS where laquinimod displayed clinical efficacy combined with a favorable safety profile. At the same time, only one of the three pivotal studies achieved the primarily endpoint, which significantly disadvantaged the regulatory potential for laquinimod in MS. Teva will continue to develop laquinimod in Huntington’s disease, a rare neurodegenerative disease, with a very high medical need for treatment targeting the actual disease. Laquinimod has shown positive effects in preclinical models for Huntington’s that could be of importance in slowing the neurodegenerative process that is typical for Huntington’s disease. The LEGATO-HD Phase II study is the first study with laquinimod in this indication and is randomized and placebo-controlled and evaluates the daily doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg laquinimod as a potential therapy for patients with Huntington’s disease. The study was fully enrolled before the summer 2017 and the results will be available in the second half of 2018. At the beginning of the year, the FDA granted laquinimod orphan drug status for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, which allows seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. ANYARA Extensive preclinical data was generated in the ANYARA project during the year, demonstrating the combination effects of ANYARA and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda which is a PD-1 inhibitor. The results support the hypothesis that ANYARA can enhance the effect of such therapy by increasing the immune system’s ability to recognize the tumor. The preclinical results led to new patent applications to protect the use of ANYARA in this combination. If these patents are granted, they would provide potential extension of ANYARA patent protection until 2036. Preparations for a clinical study of ANYARA in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with vari- ous forms of advanced cancer are ongoing and the study is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2018. Tasquinimod In the past year, tasquinimod was granted patents for use in multiple myeloma in both Europe and the US. With patents secured in key markets until 2035 and orphan drug status granted in multiple myeloma, we have now created highly favorable conditions for the continued advancement of tasquinimod. Although new treatments have greatly improved prognosis and survival of multiple myeloma patients, there is still a significant need for new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as tasquinimod. Discussions with clinical experts and potential partners in relation to the continued clinical development and commercialization of the project are ongoing. SILC and Paquinimod During the past year, we secured product patents in the US for two of three patent families in the SILC project. Work aimed at clarifying the role of S100A9 as a target molecule in immuno-oncology is proceeding and data from the SILC project was presented at the scientific meeting ”Tumor Models” in London at the beginning of December. We are currently focusing on demonstrating proof of concept for SILC substances in humanized tumor models, which is important for the continued commercial activities in the project. Commercial activities are in progress in the paquinimod project to identify a new partner for continued clinical development in systemic sclerosis, where paquinimod has orphan drug designation in both the US and Europe. Closing words As I look back at the past year, I can say that it has been a challenging year with decisive, negative events in the MS project with laquinimod together with our partner Teva. At the same time, I am pleased with what we have achieved in other projects, where we attained important milestones for continued development. In 2018 I am looking forward to the results of the LEGATO study and recommencing the clinical development of ANYARA. Furthermore, we will focus on continuing to develop value in the tasquinimod, paquinimod and SILC projects. In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our employees and shareholders for your loyal support over the past year. Helén Tuvesson, CEO

For the Annual General Meeting in May, the Nomination Committee of AAK AB proposed new election of Mikael Ekdahl as Chairman of the Board and Gun Nilsson and Bengt Baron as Board members. The Annual General Meeting resolved in accordance with the proposal. Following the strategy to broaden our nutritional focus we delivered our first volumes of Akovita® in June. Akovita® is our new product range for the senior nutrition market and contains ingredients such as plant sterol esters which are clinically proven to maintain and even reduce the cholesterol level in the blood which is supported by Article 14(1) health claim in the EU. In July, our CEO and President Arne Frank suddenly and very unfortunately passed away. Arne joined AAK in 2010 and developed AAK into a world-leading player in the market for value-adding vegetable oils and fats. The smallest business area, Technical Products & Feed, reported an operating profit of SEK 84 million (100), a decrease by 16 percent. Operating profit per kilo decreased by 17 percent, to SEK 0.30 (0.36). Operating cash flow including changes in working capital amounted to SEK 1,099 million (1,213). Cash flow from working capital was negative, amounting to SEK 388 million (negative 263). Good working capital management has impacted cash flow favorably. However, this was offset by a continued organic volume growth, a net nega- tive impact from higher raw material prices, and working capital tied up for our new factories in Brazil and China. Earnings per share increased by 19 percent, to SEK 28.24 (23.71). Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), calculated on a rolling 12 months basis, was 15.6 percent (15.8). ROCE declined due to increased raw material prices which impacted the first six months in 2017, investments in Brazil and China, and the acquisition of California Oils Corporation in 2016. Our new speciality and semi-speciality edible oils factory in Zhangjiagang, China was officially inaugurated in September. With the new plant in operation, we have taken a major step forward in our global growth strategy and it brings us closer to our customers in yet another key market. The fully automated, multi-oil and multi-process plant has an initial production capacity of 100,000 MT per year, and opens up many new possibilities for our customers in China in a wide range of applications. In November, AAK’s Board of Directors appointed Johan Westman as new President and CEO of AAK AB. Prior to joining AAK, Johan was Senior Vice President Europe and Managing Director of the BlankLight division at Shiloh Industries, a global innovative solutions provider to the mobility market with headquarters in Valley City, Ohio, USA. Johan will start no later than June 1, 2018. At the end of December, we signed our first commercial contract for TROPICAO™, our chocolate solution for hot climate markets.

Halting climate change requires a fundamental transformation of the world's energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. DONG Energy is the energy company in Europe which has come the furthest in the transition to renewable energy, and 2016 was yet another important milestone. The Group's earnings from Wind Power doubled to DKK 11.9 billion and for the first time exceeded earnings from oil and gas production. We installed 0.6GW of new offshore wind capacity and completed the conversions of two CHP plants in Aarhus and Copenhagen to sustainable biomass. The Group's CO2 emissions have been halved relative to 2006, and our goal is for DONG Energy to phase out coal completely by 2023. The transformation of our business to increasingly more renewable energy also means becoming more international. Today, we are constructing and operating offshore wind farms in Denmark, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, while also maturing new projects in the USA and Taiwan. In June 2016, we completed an IPO, the biggest in Danish history, and in December 2016, DONG Energy was included in the OMX C20 index on Nasdaq Copenhagen. I would like to thank both Danish and international investors for the trust which they have shown our company. In November 2016, we decided to initiate a process aimed at divesting the Group's oil and gas production activities. The decision should be seen in light of our desire to become world-leading in green energy. We have created a strong and competitive oil and gas business in the North Sea. The time has now come to find new owners who can provide the best possible conditions for developing this business area. Our efforts to improve safety continued in 2016, and the injury frequency was at a record low. Making DONG Energy an even safer workplace is a key priority for the Board of Directors. We will therefore continue our efforts to improve safety standards to ensure that everybody working for DONG Energy – our employees and our business partners – get safely through their working day. Profit after tax for the year was DKK 12.2 billion for the continuing operations – the best result ever in the history of DONG Energy and a significant increase compared to 2015. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank our management and employees for the significant results achieved in the past year.

We want to revolutionise the way we power people by developing green, independent and economically viable energy systems. By doing so, we create value for the societies that we are a part of and for all our stakeholders. The way we work is based on five guiding principles: Integrity We are open and trustworthy and uphold high ethical standards Results We set the bar high, take ownership and get the right things done Passion We are passionate about what we do and proud of what we achieve Safety We never compromise on health and safety standards Team We value diversity and collaborate in a non-hierarchical, respectful and trusting way Integrity is our root.

Today, more than 80% of the world’s energy supply comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which leads to serious climate change and impacts people’s living conditions all over the planet. If we are to slow down this development, we need to supply the world with energy in a sustainable manner. Over a period of 11 years, Ørsted has been transformed from a Danish utility company based on coal, oil and gas to an international energy company based on green energy. In 2017, we decided to phase out our use of coal by 2023, and we divested our oil and gas business. We also guaranteed our Danish resi- dential customers that the power they receive from us is generated by offshore wind farms. With the decisions we made in 2017, we com- pleted our strategic transformation from black to green energy. None of the other major en- ergy companies in Europe have come this far in their transformation processes, and among this group, we are now the fastest-growing company. As a result, we are a completely different company today. That is why we de- cided to change our name to Ørsted, inspired by the world-renowned Danish scientist H.C. Ørsted. Our vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. We have strong competences within sustainable energy solutions in all parts of our “With the decisions we made in 2017, we completed our strategic transformation from black to green energy. None of the other major energy companies in Europe have come this far in their transfor- mation processes. business. We want to build on these strengths and help the world’s transformation to green energy systems. Our commitment to sustainability is funda- mental. We therefore run our business in a way that supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In our Sustainabil- ity Report, you can read more about how we contribute to these goals. The heading for our strategy is ’Green growth’. In the coming years, growth will primarily be driven by our build-out of offshore wind, where we have the largest investment programme in the sector. We are also looking into new growth opportunities within green energy generation, intelligent customer solutions and solutions integrating generation and consumption. per share, enabling us to retain an attractive level of dividend. In 2017, we continued our tireless work to im- prove safety for our employees and suppliers. We achieved a lost-time injury frequency of 1.6, the lowest level ever in the Group’s history. On this basis, we are now switching to an even more fine-meshed measuring method comprising all accidents, whether they lead to absence or not. Profit for the year from continuing operations amounted to DKK 13.3 billion, our best ever result. The Board of Directors recommends to the annual general meeting that dividend payments be increased from DKK 6 to DKK 9 On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank the management and employees for having created one of the most successful energy companies in Europe, and one that is leading the way towards a world which runs entirely on green energy.

Making strides in smokeless Much has changed since Swedish Match was listed as a publicly traded company in 1996. Back then, our smokeless tobacco busi- ness consisted of chewing tobacco and moist snuff in the US, and snus in Scandinavia. Snus and moist snuff combined were about as big as chewing tobacco in terms of sales, and together, snus and moist snuff accounted for about one-eighth of company sales. Today, Swedish Match is truly a different company with a truly dif- ferent vision. Dramatically higher sales for snus and moist snuff, an emerging snus business in the US, and opportunities for the intro- duction and development of traditional and modern forms of smokeless tobacco worldwide are only a few of the phenomenal changes over the years.

Vi har revideret årsregnskabet for 2CureX ApS for regnskabsåret 1. januar - 31. december 2016, der om- fatter resultatopgørelse, balance og noter, herunder anvendt regnskabspraksis (”regnskabet”). Grundlag for konklusion Vi har udført vores revision i overensstemmelse med internationale standarder om revision og de yderlige- re krav, der er gældende i Danmark. Vores ansvar ifølge disse standarder og krav er nærmere beskrevet i revisionspåtegningens afsnit ”Revisors ansvar for re- visionen af regnskabet”. Vi er uafhængige af selskabet i overensstemmelse med internationale etiske regler for revisorer (IESBA’s Etiske regler) og de yderligere krav, der er gældende i Danmark, ligesom vi har op- fyldt vores øvrige etiske forpligtelser i henhold til disse regler og krav. Det er vores opfattelse, at det op- nåede revisionsbevis er tilstrækkeligt og egnet som grundlag for vores konklusion. We have audited the Financial Statements of 2CureX ApS for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies (”the Financial State- ments”). Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna- tional Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additio- nal requirements applicable in Denmark. Our re- sponsibilities under those standards and require- ments are further described in the ”Auditor’s re- sponsibilities for the audit of the Financial State- ments” section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Internatio- nal Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require- ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Ved udarbejdelsen af regnskabet er ledelsen ansvar- lig for at vurdere selskabets evne til at fortsætte drif- ten; at oplyse om forhold vedrørende fortsat drift, hvor dette er relevant; samt at udarbejde regnskabet på grundlag af regnskabsprincippet om fortsat drift, medmindre ledelsen enten har til hensigt at likvidere selskabet, indstille driften eller ikke har andet reali- stisk alternativ end at gøre dette. Revisors ansvar for revisionen af regnskabet Vores mål er at opnå høj grad af sikkerhed for, om regnskabet som helhed er uden væsentlig fejlinforma- tion, uanset om denne skyldes besvigelser eller fejl, og at afgive en revisionspåtegning med en konklu- sion. Høj grad af sikkerhed er et højt niveau af sikker- hed, men er ikke en garanti for, at en revision, der ud- føres i overensstemmelse med internationale standar- der om revision og de yderligere krav, der er gælden- de i Danmark, altid vil afdække væsentlig fejlinforma- tion, når sådan findes. Fejlinformationer kan opstå som følge af besvigelser eller fejl og kan betragtes som væsentlige, hvis det med rimelighed kan forven- tes, at de enkeltvis eller samlet har indflydelse på de økonomiske beslutninger, som brugerne træffer på grundlag af regnskabet.
