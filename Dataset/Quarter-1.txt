Growth in Sweden was 21 percent with sales of SEK 253.9m (209.1), of which  organic growth for former AcandoFrontec was 13 percent. The operating profit  simultaneously increased by 49 percent to SEK 26.9m.    The year has started with good capacity utilisation. This level was maintained during  the entire quarter with stable prices, at the same time as demand for Acando's  services was good during the quarter and volumes with existing customers are  increasing. This implies that Acando continues to need considerable recruitment of  consultants within many fields of expertise.     Germany    Pro forma sales grew in Germany by 22 percent to SEK 63.5m. The office in Bremen  – whose results include the effect of recruitment costs – has got off to a good start  for the year and profitability is in line with expectations. The office in Düsseldorf  reported a loss for the quarter but is expected to reverse this trend in the beginning  of Q2. The significantly largest unit, Hamburg, continued to develop well during the  period, as did the office in Frankfurt.    New customers include HSB Nordbank, Germanischer Lloyd AG (safety inspections  of ships) and ODS Optical Disc Service GmbH (optical media). Major assignments  have been obtained from Airbus Spares for the A405 model, as well as BMW.    Baltic Region and Eastern Europe (Webmedia)    Webmedia has experienced good demand in the Baltic Region with an increase in  sales to SEK 19.6m (12.5), implying growth of 57 percent. The operating profit was  SEK 2.8m (1.0) representing a rise of 180 percent.    The majority of Webmedia's assignments come from the local market, although  sales of projects to Swedish customers (near-shoring) are increasing. Assignments  in the first quarter include the development of a new logistics system for the  Estonian post office and a solution for e-declarations for the Estonian tax authorities.     INTERIM REPORT   1 January - 31 March  2007            ACANDO AB (publ) 4 (12)  www.acando.com  Other countries    Demand for Acando's SAP-oriented company in Finland is good.

Acando has operations in Denmark and the United Kingdom as of March 2007.  Demand in these markets is good. The newly formed company in Denmark is still in  a start-up phase with focus on recruiting consultants – for which the related costs  have been charged to the quarter's operating results.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW  The Group's liquid assets including current investments amounted to SEK 139m (85)  as at 31 March 2007. In addition, the Group has an unutilised bank overdraft facility  of SEK 50m. The equity/assets ratio was 68.7 percent (65.9).    Cash flow from current activities for the quarter was SEK 21m (-1).

COMPULSORY REDEMPTION OF SHARES  The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  (AGM) to be held on 26 April to adopt a bonus issue and share split of 2:1 combined  with a compulsory redemption procedure. The procedure will imply, provided the  AGM gives its approval, that each share be split into one ordinary share and one  redemption share with the expected record date for the split to be 18 May and  payment of the redemption amount on or about 12 June. The last day for trading of  the Acando share and at the same time the right to redemption shares will be 14  May. The share will be listed as of 15 May without right to redemption shares.

The figures in the above table pertain to remaining operations, i.e.  without Webmedia.    The capital gain of SEK 13m regarding the sale of shares is included in the  consolidated income statement under the heading "Profit for the period from sold  operations".    Comparative figures are affected by the consolidation of the acquired companies  Deva Management as of 1 February 2007, former IQ Consultancy Ltd in the UK as  of 1 March 2007, and former Abeo Gruppen A/S in Norway as of 1 October 2007.      OPERATIONAL TRENDS PER GEOGRAPHIC MARKET    Sweden  Demand for consultancy services was strong in the quarter, with subsequent good  capacity utilisation. Sales in Sweden increased in the quarter by SEK 15m to SEK  269m compared to the same period last year. The operating profit improved in the  same period by SEK 2m to SEK 29m compared to the same period last year,  representing a rise of 7 percent. The operating margin was 10.9 percent (10.6).    The strong demand combined with a shortage of qualified consultants is resulting in  high staff mobility within the sector.    Acando strengthened its long-term cooperation agreements with several customers  during the quarter. Region Västra Götaland (VGR), Verva (the Swedish  Administrative Development Agency) and TeliaSonera have recently entered into  framework agreements with Acando. Major customers include AB Volvo,  AstraZeneca, Ericsson, TeliaSonera and Vattenfall.

United Kingdom: The company in Manchester was acquired in the first quarter 2007,  and expanded strongly last year with a breakeven result for the full year 2007.

Several new customers within the pharmaceutical and retail sectors have   INTERIM REPORT   1 January – 31 March 2008              ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (12)  www.acando.com  been obtained.

Acando has a continued good demand even though the overall economic growth came to a halt  during the fourth quarter of 2008. The operating profit, excluding restructuring costs, is  satisfying, given the current market conditions. Acando’s broad customer base has enabled a  capacity move from customer segments with declining demand (such as the automobile  industry in western Sweden) to customer segments that are still investing (such as the public  sector in  Norway).    “Acando’s significant presence within the public sector, the pharmaceutical and healthcare  industry and the energy sector means that we are less exposed to major economic declines in  other customer segments”, Acting CEO Bengt Lejdström explains.     However, the market in western Sweden has changed dramatically, why the company adjusts  both capacity and offering to the existing demand by reducing the number of consultants in the   INTERIM REPORT             1 January – 31 March 2009              ACANDO AB (publ) 2 (16)  www.acando.com  region.

   INTERIM REPORT    January 1 – March 31, 2010   Price-sensitive information that is reported   to the Financial Supervisory Authority    ACANDO AB (publ.)  Jakobsgatan 6  SE-111 52 Stockholm  Sweden  tel +46 (0)8 699 70 00  fax +46 (0)8 699 79 99  corp reg no 556272-5092  www.acando.com      1 (16)          INTERIM REPORT  JANUARY 1 – MARCH 31, 2010   Net sales amounted to SEK 360 m (409)   Operating profit amounted to SEK 19 m (22). In the preceding year, SEK 20 m in restructuring  costs was charged against operating profit.   The operating margin was 5.4 percent (5.4)   Profit after tax amounted to SEK 15 m (21)   Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.25 (0.27)   Cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 119 m (207)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The signs of stabilization seen during the latter part of 2009 were gradually strengthened during the first quarter of  2010. It is primarily in Sweden that we saw an improvement in the market situation, although competition for  assignments remained intense. Other parts of the Group continued to be affected by weak demand and price  pressure. Prerequisites vary greatly between offerings and geographic areas. The trend for net sales and operating  profit during the first quarter of 2010 reflected the fact that utilization for our consultants gradually increased for  each month.   Our work to change the business model to comprise a greater component of project-based undertakings and an  increased share of application management assignments continued. Although only a relatively few large projects  were initiated in the current market climate, Acando won a number of projects during the quarter in which we are  responsible for increasing process efficiency and rolling out the associated system support in both the Microsoft  and SAP environments.  To be able to continue providing cost-effective delivery models in both project undertakings and maintenance  phases, Acando signed a contract that gives us access to established offshore capacity in India through an  expanded partnership with the Sopra Group. Acando already has a partnership with the Sopra Group intended to  serve European customers requiring a presence in all of Europe.  The year 2010 will offer many opportunities for Acando together with new and existing customers. The focus will  remain on continued growth within current geographic areas. Recruitment work has been intensified, and we  currently see a need to recruit a net of slightly more than 100 employees to the Group during the year.      INTERIM REPORT    January 1 – March 31, 2010           ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (16)  www.acando.com    Market development  The uncertainty that characterized most of 2009  remained, although stabilization is now taking place,  particularly in Sweden. Willingness to invest is greater  among customers, and more dialogues are in progress.  Volume is being built on many small assignments, and  few larger projects are being initiated. Relatively major  sales efforts are required to win new larger assignments  in intense competition. Deviations between offerings and  geographic areas are significant. In particular, weak  demand is noted in southern Sweden and Denmark. We  also see effects of increased price competition in Norway  and Germany, compared with 2009.  Customers and offering  At the end of January 2010, Acando signed a contract  with the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO)  in Norway regarding a new business solution for relation  management, structured information sharing and  internal and external cooperation. NHO is the largest  trade organization for Norwegian companies with about  20,000 member companies.    In March, Acando received an order for the industry  solution “Microsoft AX for Process Industries” from an  international pharmaceutical company.    Net sales and profit    January – March 2010  Net sales and operating profit for the first quarter of 2010  are presented in the table below.  *Operating profit in 2009 included restructuring costs of SEK 20 m.  Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2010  amounted to SEK 360 m (409). Of the SEK 49 m decline  in net sales, about SEK 11 m was attributable to currency  effects, primarily related to the EUR trend.  Operating profit amounted to SEK 19 m (22),  corresponding to an unchanged operating margin of 5.4  percent. During the first quarter of 2009, restructuring  costs of SEK 20 m in conjunction with personnel  reductions in Gothenburg, Sweden, were charged  against operating profit.  Profit after tax amounted to SEK 15 m (21). Earnings per  share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.25 (0.27), a  decline of 7 percent.  The corporate tax recognized as an expense in the profit  and loss statement in the first quarter of 2010 comprised  the sum of current tax costs for the period and the net of  reversed and capitalized tax assets. The company had  unutilized loss carryforwards totaling SEK 415 m, which  are deemed possible to utilize over the coming years,  thus positively affecting cash flow. The Group recognized  deferred tax in an amount of SEK 109 m, which was  included as a financial asset in the balance sheet. This  asset will decrease in pace with utilization of the  deductions for loss carryforwards.

Operating profit the first quarter 2009 included restructuring costs of SEK  20 m.  Consolidated net sales in the first quarter of 2010 showed  a recovery and exceeded the fourth quarter of 2009 by 2  percent. Growth was primarily attributable to Swedish  operations in which the clearest signs of stabilization of  demand were noted. However, price pressure in certain  offerings and geographic areas restricted the Group’s  overall growth.   The operating margin for the quarter also showed a more  stable trend, compared with 2009, when weak demand  resulted in relatively low margins during the second and  third quarters.    Development of operations   by geographic market    Introduction  Net sales and operating profit distributed by geographic  market are presented in the table below.      * Operating profit in 2009 included restructuring costs of SEK 20 m.  Sweden  Utilization in Sweden gradually improved during the first  three months of the year. The Gothenburg region  continued to show a favorable trend with high utilization  and stable prices. The Stockholm region strengthened  gradually and showed favorable order bookings, while  Malmö remained weak from a utilization standpoint. All  competence areas showed a positive trend, although  price competition continued in the SAP segment.    The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin for Swedish operations from January 1,  2008 through March 31, 2010.

Operating profit for the quarter including Group costs  amounted to SEK 17 m (14), an increase of 21 percent.  Restructuring costs of SEK 20 m attributable to  personnel reductions at Acando’s office in Gothenburg  were charged against operating profit during the first  quarter of 2009. Operating profit, including Group costs  but excluding restructuring costs, amounted to SEK 17 m  (34).    In comparison with the fourth quarter of 2009, it can be  noted that net sales increased 5 percent and that the  operating margin improved by 4.1 percentage points.    In total, operations in Sweden accounted for 58 percent  of the Group’s sales during the first quarter of 2010, a  decline of 2 percentage points from the corresponding  period in the preceding year. Examples of major  customers during the period were AstraZeneca, Ericsson  Vattenfall and Volvo.    Germany  After a weak beginning of the quarter during which  several customers stopped projects in progress due to  cost-saving measures, recovery began in Germany during  the latter half of the quarter. This was largely due to the  new customers that were added during 2009 resulting in  a broader customer base. However, price competition  increased in the German market. Examples of major  customers during the quarter were EADS/Airbus,  HanseNet and Vattenfall Europe.  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin for German operations from January 1,  2008 through March 31, 2010.  Net sales during the first quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 79 m (93). Of the 15-percent decline, about 10  percentage points were related to negative currency  effects attributable to the EUR trend.  Operating profit for the quarter including Group costs  amounted to SEK 2 m (4) with an operating margin of 3.0  percent (4.2).  Norway  The demand in the Norwegian market was somewhat  weaker than during 2009, and price pressure continued,  which affected the operating margin negatively. In  addition, a guarantee commitment for a major customer  assignment was charged against operating profit for the  first quarter of 2010.  A number of new framework agreements signed during  2009 and the first quarter 2010, resulted in an expanded  customer base to be worked up. Examples of major  customers during the quarter were Politiets data og  materielltjenste and Helse Sr st.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2010          ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (16)  www.acando.com  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin for operations in Norway from January  1, 2008 through March 31, 2010.    Net sales during the first quarter amounted to SEK 39 m  (45), a 13-percent decline. The corresponding decline was  noted in local currency. Operating profit for the quarter  including Group costs amounted to SEK 0 m (3)  corresponding to an operating margin of 0.4 percent  (7.6).    Other countries  Finland: Finland continued to develop favorable with  satisfactory profitability during the first quarter of the  year. A number of new customers were added, and new  recruitments took place to meet demand. Order  bookings indicate continued positive development.  Denmark: Denmark was characterized by weak demand  and intense price competition, resulting in an action  program intended to increase sales efforts and reduce  costs. The overall effects of measures taken during the  first quarter of 2010 will be evident at the earliest during  the second quarter of the year.  UK: The UK showed continued profitability during the  first quarter. The focus of operations remained on  deliveries to AstraZeneca. The restructuring and  management changes that were implemented during the  fourth quarter of 2009 produced the desired effects, and  operations show a positive trend.  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin for Other countries from January 1,  2008 through March 31, 2010.    Net sales for Other countries during the first quarter of  2010 amounted to SEK 35 m (29), a 21-percent increase.  The increase was a net effect of both acquired sales in  Denmark and organic growth in the UK, as well as  negative currency effects in all three countries.      Financial position, cash flow and investments  Financial position    Acando has a strong financial position with an  equity/assets ratio of 70 percent (66). Consolidated cash  and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 119 m on March  31, 2010, an increase of 13 percent from December 31,  2009.

     INTERIM REPORT      January 1 – March 31, 2011    Price-sensitive information that has to be reported     to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (17)        INTERIM REPORT  JANUARY 1 –MARCH 31, 2011     Net sales SEK 398 m (360)   Operating profit SEK 34 m (19)   Operating margin 8.4 % (5.4 %)   Profit after tax SEK 23 m (15)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.30 (0.20)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 138 m (119)      Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO    During the first quarter of the year, Acando’s operations reported a healthy trend which was supported by an increasingly  strengthened market and continued operational efficiency measures. Organic growth measured in local currencies amounted  to approximately 15 percent, though negative currency effects of about 4 percentage points arose from the strengthened SEK.  A rising degree of utilization and a favorable mix of services in deliveries resulted in substantial improvement in the operating  profit to SEK 34 m from SEK 19 m in the year-earlier period. Operating margins are in line with the corresponding period  during the robust economic climate of 2008 in all countries excluding Denmark.    The development in Norway, with strong growth in sales and the highest margins in one quarter for two years, is particularly  gratifying. However, in respect of profitability, Denmark continues to pose a challenge.    Demand strengthened considerably for Microsoft solutions based on Sharepoint and SAP competence for implementation  projects and further development of existing solutions, during the quarter. Additionally, we have been able to utilize  competence and solutions between Group countries in these areas.     It is with great pleasure and pride that I report that the Nobel Foundation chose Acando as their partner for the establishment  of more efficient IT support for the planning of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony, the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm and the  other activities of Nobel Week. Our methodology of working together with our customers to identify and understand their  needs, to then define the solution and build confidence and security during the implementation process has proved decisive.    Interesting and challenging assignments are crucial for attracting the best consultants and the project for the Nobel  Foundation is one of many such examples. We have a pressing need to increase recruitment levels but have noted increasing  levels of competition for new employees. The high level of demand means a general increase in mobility amongst employees  thus affecting opportunities for organic growth. We continue to operate a trainee program and focus on recruiting young  professionals to our academies in the competence areas of Microsoft and Strategic IT. At the same time, we are increasing  volumes in our subcontractor business.        INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (17)  www.acando.com  Market development    In the first quarter, demand continued to strengthen in all  markets in which Acando operates. The increase in  demand was particularly noticeable in Germany, Norway      and the Stockholm region. The Öresund region reported a  slower pace of recovery, both in respect of prices and  demand.      In general, price levels remain stable, though somewhat  higher prices are noted in new projects connected with  specific competencies.    Customers and offering  Acando doubled its sales regarding portals and Content  Management Systems (CMS). Acando has a prominent  position in the field with skills in several CMS technologies.      Those SAP projects initiated in 2010 led to increased  demand in respect of the business system in 2011. Several  customers invested in projects to refine existing solutions.       Manufacturing industry reported an increase in demand  in respect of enhancing Supply Chain efficiency. Acando’s  ability to utilize the entire spectrum of competence in the  company, from business development to business system  expertise, has generated a number of new customer  assignments.     Several new framework agreements in the public sector,  primarily in Sweden and Norway, further strengthened the  customer base.     In the first quarter of 2011, Acando gained the following  major orders:      In Norway, the Norwegian Association of Literary  Translators decided to utilize the support of Acando to  implement Microsoft’s CRM-solution for cloud  computing to obtain improved control of its own  contact information.    Acando signed an agreement in March 2011 with  Aarhus Karlshamn (AAK) in respect of the operation  and monitoring of AAK’s SAP environment. In parallel,  a framework agreement was signed for SAP and  strategic IT consultancy services.   In March 2011, the Nobel Foundation chose Acando to  develop IT support for the Nobel Foundation’s work  with the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony and the Nobel  Banquet in Stockholm as well as the planning of the  Nobel Week’s program.   In Germany, Acando signed a three-year contract with  Logwin for operation of a logistics system for the  distribution of periodicals and newspapers.    Net sales and profit    January – March 2011  Net sales and operating profit for the first quarter of 2011  are presented in the following table:    Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2011  amounted to SEK 398 m (360), representing growth of  about 11 percent. The strengthening of the SEK, mainly in  relation to the EUR, had a negative impact on total growth  by approximately 4 percentage points.     Operating profit totaled SEK 34 m (19), which represents  an increase of about 74 percent compared with the year- earlier period. The operating margin rose to 8.4 percent  (5.4). The improvement in the margin was primarily  attributable to increased operating profit in Sweden and  Norway.       Profit after tax amounted to SEK 23 m (15). Earnings per  share after dilution were SEK 0.30 (0.20), an increase of 50  percent.

Compared with the first quarter of 2010, growth  of approximately 11 percent was noted.     The operating margin in the first quarter of 2011 was  approximately 2 percentage points lower than in the robust  fourth quarter of 2010. The main reason for this was a  lower operating profit in Germany attributable to  customary seasonal variations.  Development of operations by geographic market     Introduction    Net sales and operating profit distributed by geographic  market are presented in the following table:     Sweden    The market situation in Sweden remained favorable in the  first quarter of 2011, with increased demand in all  competence areas and geographic locations. The  Stockholm region, including the Västerås office, reported a  favorable trend in the degree of utilization. Operations in  Gothenburg maintained healthy profitability even at the  start of 2011. Capacity utilization gradually improved at the  Malmö office, even if at a slower pace than the other  regions.      During the quarter, established and new customers have  increased their levels of activity in the SAP area, which has  led to a rising degree of utilization and new assignments.     The volume of subcontracting business has increased to  meet growing demand. This in turn entails a somewhat  lower operating margin compared with manning with own  employees.     0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Net sales Operating profit Operating margin SEK m   2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 223 208 23 17 10,4% 8,4% Germany 78 79 4 2 5,0% 3,0% Norway 52 39 5 0 9,3% 0,4% Other countries 48 35 2 0 4,2% -1,1% Group adjustments -3 -1 0 0 - - Total 398 360 34 19 8,4% 5,4% January - March   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (17)  www.acando.com  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  the operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period January 2009 through March 2011:    Net sales for the first quarter of 2011 amounted to SEK 223  m (208), corresponding to growth of 7 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 23 m (17), up approximately 35 percent.  The operating margin rose by 2.0 percentage points to 10.4  percent (8.4). The utilization ratio, hourly rates and number  of hours available were higher in the first quarter of 2011,  while the number of consultants was lower than in the  year-earlier period.     Overall, operations in Sweden generated 56 percent (58)  of the Group’s net sales during the first quarter of 2011.      Examples of major customers in the period were  AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Volvo and Stockholm County  Council.      Germany    During the quarter, demand improved further in Germany.  Acando had major successes in its competence areas of  CMS and Microsoft-based solutions. In addition, Acando  continued strengthening its position in the bank and  finance sector.     A slight increase in prices could be reported for new  projects and for specific competencies.     In January 2011, the management in Acando GmbH was  strengthened with the appointment of Guido Ahle as  second Managing Director.    The following graph shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for operations in Germany  during the period January 2009 through March 2011:    Net sales in the first quarter of 2011 totaled SEK 78 m,  which was in line with the corresponding period in the  preceding year. However, the SEK has strengthened  against the EUR and in local currency, Germany posted  growth of about 11 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  strengthened to SEK 4 m (2), with an operating margin of  5.0 percent (3.0).     Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, Vattenfall, HSH Nordbank and Teléfonica.       0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 14,0% 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (17)  www.acando.com  Norway      In Norway, the successes reported in the public sector  continued with a number of projects based on open-source  solutions in parallel with a number of new framework  agreements further increasing the customer base.      Demand is substantial in the private sector for Microsoft  solutions. Another growth area for Acando is portal  solutions based on several key contracts during the  quarter.    The graph below shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from January 2009 through March 2011:  Net sales in the first quarter of 2011 totaled SEK 52 m (39),  corresponding to growth of approximately 34 percent. In  local currency, growth amounted to approximately 45  percent.      Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 5 m (0) and the margin rose to 9.3  percent (0.4), which was attributable to a higher degree of  utilization and improved project profitability.     Examples of major customers during the period were  Norway's National Police Computing and Material Service  (PDMT), NAV and DnB Nor Bank (Vital).    Other countries    Finland: Finland started the year with a strong quarter and  a high utilization rate in parallel with the conclusion of a  number of major projects. The order book appears healthy  and includes orders from established and new customers.     Examples of major customers during the period were  Altia, Cargotech and Veho.    Denmark: Danish operations are undergoing restructuring  to build profitability. The degree of utilization in SAP  operations reported a positive trend.    UK: The UK demonstrated continued favorable growth and  profitability trends. Operational focus remains on  deliveries of advanced program management services to  AstraZeneca in the UK and abroad. In addition, a number  of new customer relationships were established during the  quarter based on the existing service offering.  The graph below shows the trend for net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Other countries during the  period January 2009 through March 2011:    Net sales by operations in Other countries during the first  quarter of 2011 amounted to SEK 48 m (35), an increase of  approximately 37 percent. The increase was primarily  attributable to strong growth in local currency in Finland of  about 70 percent and in the UK of about 140 percent. In  Denmark net sales declined as a result of the restructuring  of operations. Currency effects totaling about SEK 3 m  negatively impacted overall growth for Other countries.  -15,0% -10,0% -5,0% 0,0% 5,0% 10,0% 15,0% 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m -15,0% -10,0% -5,0% 0,0% 5,0% 10,0% 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2012  Price-sensitive information that has to be reported  to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (19)        INTERIM REPORT    January 1 – March 31, 2012   Net sales SEK 408 m (398)   Operating profit SEK  34 m (34)     Operating margin 8.4% (8.4 %)   Profit after tax SEK 24 m (23)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK o.34 (0.30)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 130 m (138).            Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In general terms, the market continues to be healthy and we have noted no immediate slowdown or any additional concerns  compared with the end of 2011. However, a certain degree of inertia continues to characterize decision processes and more  well-informed, close dialogs are required to secure new projects. Our methodology based on the production of short iterative  solutions in close dialog with multiple stakeholders at our customers has proved successful and we continue to secure projects  encompassing business development and IT components. Our management consulting activities provide a unique competitive  advantage in these customer dialogs.    Sweden remains our most important market and continues to post a stable earnings trend.  Our positioning initiative with our  three areas, Management Consulting, Enterprise Solutions and IT Consulting have provided Acando with greater clarity vis-à- vis the market and generated opportunities for new customer dialogs, which, in turn, delivered new business opportunities. All  three areas deliver satisfactory results. Our single greatest challenge is matching all the interesting and challenging  assignments with even more of the markets’ best consultants. We continue to recruit and, in the spring, will hold a number of  young professional academies to attract many new employees. Specifically, we currently have a substantial need in Strategic  IT, Microsoft-based solutions and in Management Consulting.    Demand remains stable in Germany, though at a lower level than in the first half of 2011. We are continuing to widen the  customer base for the long-term improvement of margins and to increase the possibilities of achieving a consistently high  degree of utilization. During the quarter, we have succeeded in securing a number of key new customer orders in the retail and  energy sectors.     In Norway, we have invested in a campaign to increase recruitment and enhance our market position. The aim is to strengthen  private sector customers’ awareness of our strength in Microsoft-based solutions. In addition, we intend to continue growing  to meet healthy public sector demand in our core areas of Strategic IT and System development.    Yet again, Finland and the UK posted another excellent performance. It is gratifying to see that we are continuing to develop  the customer base with several new customers in the UK and we have had great success with a major project in Finland where  we implemented a mobile solution for YIT.  Business system mobility is an area where we perceive a growing need and we  have an excellent opportunity to take a prominent position, which we have secured through the acquisition of Bitec.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (19)  www.acando.com   Significant events    First quarter 2012  During the first quarter of 2012, Acando completed the previously announced initiative of refining and clarifying its market  offering. Acando’s core offering is divided into three main categories: Business Development, Business Systems and IT  Solutions, which interact in the endeavor of creating measurable results for each customer assignment. Being clearer in our  communication and production of offerings will contribute to differentiating Acando’s market position. Acando’s customer  promise continues to be sustainable business enhancements through information technology.  Significant events after the end of the period  In April, Acando Sweden signed a contract with Fora for the support and management of their SAP environment and, in  parallel, a five-year framework agreement was signed for SAP consulting services. Fora administers collective agreement  insurances and other occupational insurances for 210 000 companies and their 4 million employees. Additionally Fora manage  pension solutions and information pertaining to SAF-LO Collective Pension Insurance and other private sector pension  solutions.    Business activities    Market development  2012 started with general healthy demand in line with demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. The market is strongest  in Sweden and Norway with slightly weaker demand in Germany and price levels remain unchanged compared with the  second half of 2011. An element of inertia continues with regard to the decision processes regarding major system  implementation projects and there is even a somewhat prolonged decision process for business development assignments.    Customers and offering  Demand remained high for business-system related services through the start of the year. Acando’s unit specializing in SAP  mobility solutions implemented an SAP-integrated mobile solution for YIT in 2011. YIT is a company engaged in building  systems, construction and industrial services. The turnkey solution enables a higher degree of mobile communication for  service technicians with SAP’s business system. In the first quarter, an agreement was made to continue the rollout of the  system. Approximately 1,500 users are planned in the Nordic operations and a total of 5,000 users planned around Europe.     CRM solutions based on Microsoft’s CRM platform continue to increase. Acando Norway signed a contract with Isolaft AS to  implement Dynamics CRM. Acando was selected as a partner for the implementation of a Microsoft Dynamics CRM solution to  enhance the company’s control of customer activities and sales processes. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 will equip Isolaft  with a complete CRM solution that rapidly and simply provides the company with access in all matters concerning the  company’s customer relations.    In the first quarter, the offering in Germany was expanded through a local initiative in Dusseldorf providing IT Service  Management services. This strengthens the business area in western Germany and increases the degree of specialization in  ITIL processes, which mean infrastructure management, infrastructure architecture, service management, IT operation and  procurement. In addition, Acando has increased the offering in Finland through the acquisition of the consulting firm Bitec Oy  specializing in mobile solutions. Through the acquisition of the Finnish company, Acando will strengthen its position in mobile  technology projects and mobile solutions in Finland and in other Nordic countries.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (19)  www.acando.com  Net sales and profit    January – March 2012  Net sales and operating profit for the first quarter 2012 are shown in the table below:        Consolidated net sales for the first quarter 2012 amounted to SEK 408 m (398), representing growth of 2.4 percent. Growth  excluding currency effects was 1.9 percent. Excluding the divested Danish operations, growth measured in local currency was  about 3.4 percent for the Group.    Operating profit was SEK 34 m (34), corresponding to an operating margin of 8.4 percent (8.4). Operations in Sweden posted  the Group’s highest operating margin at 11 percent. Profit after tax totaled SEK 24 m (23). Earnings per share after dilution  amounted to SEK 0.34 (0.30).    The 2011 figures for Other countries included turnover from the divested Danish operations of SEK 7  m and an operating loss  of SEK 2 m. For 2012, the item Group adjustment includes unallocated non-operating expenses, which were previously fully  allocated.          Profit trend per quarter  Net sales and operating profit on a rolling 12-month basis  per quarter for the period through the first quarter 2012.   Each quarter in the table corresponds to earnings for a full  year. Operating profit is recognized before goodwill  amortization, EBITA.  The EBITA margin was 8.2 percent for the past 12-month  period.         2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 SEK m Net              sales Net              sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 232 223 25 23 11,0% 10,4% Germany 80 78 5 4 6,3% 5,0% Norway 55 52 4 5 8,0% 9,3% Other contries 43 48 5 2 10,9% 4,2% Group adjustments -2 -3 -5 0 - - Totalt 408 398 34 34 8,4% 8,4% January - March 56% 19% 13% 12% Netsales Sweden Germany Norway Other contries  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (19)  www.acando.com  Development of operations by geographic market      Introduction  Acando is an IT and management consulting company with approximately 1,000 employees allocated over 18 offices in five  countries. The head office is in Stockholm and Sweden accounts for 56 percent of operations followed by Germany with 19  percent and Norway with 13 percent. The remaining 12 percent is accounted for by operations in Finland and the UK, which are  reported together under the item Other countries.    Sweden  Utilization rates remained favorable during the quarter and general demand is at the same level as the preceding quarter for  Swedish operations. In conjunction with the completion of projects, some units had a lower utilization rate, which impacted  parts of the results. The Recruit & Retain unit was built up during the first quarter to accelerate Acando’s program for organic  growth. The unit comprises recruitment specialists tasked with securing the inflow of top consultants and with ensuring the  development of existing employees. In many areas of expertise there is a substantial shortage of qualified personnel, which  leads to the continuation of a relatively significant level of use of sub-consultants to manage ongoing and new assignments.     IT Consulting operations, including Strategic IT and IT Solutions, reported continued healthy growth with many interesting  assignments. Acando continues to deliver SAP and Microsoft Dynamics based business systems and, during the first quarter,  concluded a number of agreements with new and previous customers. Within the area of Management Consulting, a number  of new customers were secured during the quarter and we anticipate continued healthy demand.    All geographic regions reported healthy trends, with the Stockholm region as the strongest market.    Germany  Acando Germany is continuing work to enhance the efficiency of implementation efforts for customers regarding the  introduction of Microsoft-based solutions and has documented its experiences in a publication titled – Perfect Projects –  Achieving IT Plans Smoothly. This includes the compiled experience gained, advice and a guide to efficient IT project  management.  Growth at new customers further reduced the dependency on major customers in parallel with an increase in the number of  customer segments targeted. The general level of demand in Germany is somewhat lower than in other markets, but no  further weakening was noted in the quarter.   A slight decline in the utilization rate applied to operations in Hamburg at the end of the quarter, this was in conjunction with  transitions between projects and resulted in a negative effect on eranings. Margins are under pressure from projects, based on  framework agreement with major customers, while profitability slightly exceeds other customer segments.      INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (19)  www.acando.com  Norway  The market in Norway remained strong with continued healthy demand. Acando continues to deliver services to the public  sector and, during the quarter, developed a solution to digitize parish registers in Norway. Concurrently, continued expansion  of public sector projects led to healthy development in the Strategic IT area, primarily in Enterprise Architecture.  Additional  agreements were concluded pertaining to deliveries of business solutions for member-based operations such as that  developed for the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) in 2011.  This has increased the proportion of private sector  projects and thus the ability to obtain a better price mix for the assignment base as a whole.  In the first quarter, Acando Norway invested in a campaign to increase recruitment and create an improved market position  with regard to the private sector.    Other countries  Finland: The SAP mobility solutions initiative continues and the acquisition completed at the start of the year is expected to  provide expertise in mobile technology and mobile solutions in Finland and the rest of the Nordic region.    UK: Market growth is generally low in the UK and negative in the IT sector. Despite this, Acando continues to grow in the UK  with increased profitability through close relationships with existing and new customers.

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2013     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported                                                                                   to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (19)        INTERIM REPORT    FIRST QUARTER JANUARY 1 – MARCH 31, 2013   Net sales SEK 366 m (408)   Operating profit SEK 18 m (34)     Operating margin 5.0% (8.4%)   Profit after tax SEK 14 m (24)   Earnings per share SEK 0.19 (0.34)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 115 m (130)          Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In the beginning of 2013, continued caution has prevailed in the market with increased competition for business. In the market  in Sweden, the situation remained unchanged compared with the last quarter of 2012. In Germany, a slight decline in demand  was noted compared with the end of the preceding year. In Acando’s other markets, the situation was unchanged compared  with the second half of the preceding year. The perception we gather from our customer dialogues and project-specific  discussions is that there are opportunities and ideas that are waiting to be realized. However, the market will continue to be  typified by protracted decision processes and competition for assignments in the first half of the year.   The first quarter of 2013 had fewer working days than the corresponding quarter in 2012, which negatively impacted sales and  earnings. The utilization rate declined due to the protracted decision processes but also due to the deferment of decided or  ongoing projects.  Together, the above resulted in a quarter with performance below our expectations and we are continuing our efforts through  intensified customer dialogues and increased operational efficiency. As always, we need to hone our expertise in a softer  market and, on an ongoing basis, we are adapting the pace of recruitment and total staffing in line with actual and estimated  future demand. As a result, we still have a net recruitment need in specific areas, such as SAP, Strategic IT and senior IT roles,  while we are adapting our resources to meet lower demand in other areas.   In Radar Group’s annual survey of customer perceptions of supplier quality, we were yet again ranked as one of the consulting  companies with the highest level of perceived quality. The creation of lasting value and being a highly intuitive business  partner with integrity are decisive for our continued development. An example of the importance of these qualities is provided  by the recently signed agreements regarding the continued implementation of SAP at the Perstorp Group, where the  customer’s perception of us as intuitive, flexible and professional in combination with previous experience of working together  resulted in a continuation of the assignment.  In a business environment where the increasing importance of the ability to couple the possibilities provided by technology to  the challenges facing the business furnishes Acando with all the prerequisites necessary to continue to play a crucial role. The  complexity of the cases with which our customers continue to challenge us with is, we believe, an indication of the high level of  confidence in our ability as well as our approach and our actions. Our consultants live by our values: Team Spirit, Passion and  Results, on a daily basis, which is what, in the end creates the image our customers have of Acando.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (19)  www.acando.com  Significant events    First quarter, 2013  Acando signed a framework agreement with a Swedish company that is part of a global retail group. Under the framework  agreement, the group companies have the right to call-off services. The agreement applies for a three-year period and  comprises Acando’s entire offering in Management Consulting and IT Consulting services in Sweden and Germany.       Significant events after the end of the period  Since the end of the period, Acando has signed agreements with Perstorp. Acando became Perstorp’s implementation partner  for the approaching roll-out of Perstorp’s SAP solution.           Business activities    Market development  At the start of the year, the market softened slightly compared with the end of 2012 and project implementation decisions are  becoming increasingly protracted. An increasing number of procurements are also characterized by a greater degree of  competition and the involvement of more parties. It has also been noted that those projects that are implemented have an  increasing degree of delimitation and are divided into more phases to increase the customers’ ability to cancel the project  early, since the market is generally unstable for several of Acando’s customers. The exception is the market in Norway where  continued healthy demand is noted, primarily in the public sector.    Customers and offering  Acando’s operations in Strategic IT have trended favorably during the quarter with increased assignments among existing  customers, both in the form of call-offs against existing framework agreements and in the form of expanded and new projects.  Demand is healthy and Acando’s position is well-established as one of the largest and most highly qualified suppliers.    The Management Consulting area trended weakly during the quarter. The assignment portfolio comprises a number of smaller  assignments, often divided into stages. Several major assignments were deferred during the quarter, which led to a lower  utilization rate. Acando’s assignments are often initiated by a dialog about business enhancements, which in latter phases  result in major change or implementation projects. The volume of such dialogs remained unchanged compared with the fourth  quarter. However, the process leading up to implementation is now longer. Customers require deeper analysis and stipulate  requirements for increased and more rapid realization of the investments’ expected effect.    Business system operations were characterized by healthy demand in the SAP area while demand for Microsoft-based  business systems was somewhat lower. Enquiries and ongoing projects in the SAP area provide healthy utilization rates and  the agreement with Perstorp pertaining to the continued implementation of their SAP solution also demonstrates Acando’s  position and ability to drive implementations forward in an efficient and safe manner.     In the IT area, the market is characterized by caution concerning new projects and major investments. There is a clear increase  in competition for project assignments and the supply of specialists.        INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (19)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    First quarter January – March 2013  Net sales and operating profit/loss for the first quarter 2013 are shown in the table below:      Consolidated net sales for the first quarter amounted to SEK 366 m (408). Growth excluding currency effects declined 8.4  percent compared with the strong first quarter in 2012. The weighted number of working days for the first quarter was 62 for  the Group compared with 64.5 the preceding year which had a negative impact on growth of 3.8 percent. Norway was  impacted the most from Easter falling in the first quarter of the year compared with the second quarter the preceding year and  the difference in working days was 4.    Operating profit was SEK 18 m (34), corresponding to an operating margin of 5.0 percent (8.4). It was primarily the weak  market in Sweden in combination with lower utilization rates that negatively impacted earnings compared with 2012.  Together with the negative calendar effect, both growth and operating margin were negatively impacted. Germany, which  ended 2012 on a high note, had a weaker start to the year. Profit after tax totaled SEK 14 m (24). Earnings per share after  dilution amounted to SEK 0.19 (0.34).          Profit trend per quarter   The diagram on the right shows net sales and operating  profit for the past three years and for the first quarter of  2013.   In terms of work, the last quarter is the most work intensive  with the highest number of working days. The third quarter  is always lower due to holidays.  The industry in which Acando operates is late-cyclical and a  weak market impacts with a delay of about one quarter,  the same applies when the market turns.               2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 SEK m Net              sales Net              sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 202.7 232.1 12.2 25.5 6.0 % 11.0 % Germany 71.1 79.7 1.5 5.0 2.1 % 6.3 % Norway 53.5 55.0 3.0 4.4 5.6 % 8.0 % Other countries 40.5 43.0 4.5 4.7 11.1 % 10.9 % Group adjustments -2.2 -1.9 -2.7 -5.1 - - Total 365.7 407.9 18.3 34.4 5.0 % 8.4 % January - March 55% 19% 15% 11% Net sales Sweden Germany Norway Other countries  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (19)  www.acando.com  Development of operations by geographic market    Introduction  Acando is a management and IT consulting company that, in partnership with its customers, enhances and streamlines  processes, organizations and IT. Acando has approximately 1,100 employees allocated over 18 offices in five countries. The  head office is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Operations in Sweden account for 55 percent of operations followed by Germany  with 19 percent and Norway with 15 percent. The remaining 11 percent is accounted for by operations in Finland and the UK,  which are reported together under the heading Other countries.      Sweden  Softer demand during the quarter led to a lower utilization rate and lower operating margin compared with year-earlier period.   Gothenburg and Malmö reported slightly weaker demand than the Stockholm area, while Västerås trended favorably during  the quarter.    In Management Consulting, the market remained weak and assignments were generally short assignments in stages with new  decision points ahead of each stage. This means that the utilization rate was kept down and that the processing of new  customers and assignments takes longer.      In the Strategic IT area, utilization rates remained normal, with many new smaller assignments and continued projects. The  general nature of the projects focused on streamlining and enhancing efficiency. One example consists of a turnkey delivery  whereby Acando delivers tools and methods to reduce costs for purchasing consumables at Stockholm South General Hospital  (SöS). This is one example of how the opportunity to combine process definition, the development of relevant IT support and  actual implementation has been decisive.     During the quarter, the SAP area developed favorably driven by a number of ongoing projects. In the same period, a number of  new projects were secured, including the implementation at Perstorp, as well as many smaller upgrades and roll-outs in  previously implemented projects. In terms of demand and operations, the SAP area appears stable and SAP’s launch of new  platforms and solutions will drive future demand for which Acando is favorably placed. Demand for in the area of Microsoft  Dynamics-based business systems is more dependent on new implementations with accompanying projects, which has meant  weaker development in this area due to the start of fewer major projects in the first quarter.     After a weak start to the quarter, the IT area has recovered to some extent, even if utilization rates are lower year-on-year.  Project procurements are characterized by intense competition and price pressure is increasing in specialist contracts. The  volume is built up by numerous smaller projects with shorter durations. The integration area and Acando’s offering pertaining  to skills centers for integration performed favorably with many new customers during the quarter while the business  intelligence area developed slightly weaker.    During the Easter holidays, in partnership with Microsoft, Digigirlz was implemented at Acando’s office in Gothenburg. The  project aims to increase interest in technology among junior high school girls.         INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (19)  www.acando.com  Germany  The first quarter is generally a weak season with many projects in the start-up phase, but the first quarter of the year also  noted several negative effects. The market in Germany gradually declined over the quarter, in parallel with two of Acando’s  largest customers in Hamburg making significant cutbacks in their volumes, which will continue to negatively impact earnings  even in the coming quarter. Volumes from new customers did not fully offset the above and this resulted in low utilization  rates for the quarter, which negatively impacts the operating margin. Focus is on operational efficiency and intensified efforts  to create volumes among new customers.  Operations in southern Germany developed favorably with satisfactory utilization rates and a stable customer base while  western Germany with Düsseldorf as its central location performed more weakly.  During the quarter, a number of new solutions were launched, including an upgraded version of RelaGain, a Microsoft  Dynamics CRM-based solution produced for operations in the banking and finance sectors.   Norway  Acando continues to focus on growth in Norway and, at the start of the year, split operations into two main areas. One area is  based on Microsoft-based solutions for the private sector and the other area focuses on consulting and specialist services in  architecture and Java expertise based on the framework agreements with the public sector.     Consulting services in architecture trended extremely positively with a major need for recruitment. Since there is a scarcity of  qualified, senior consultants in the Norwegian market, we have bolstered the inflow of Swedish resources. Acando now has  assignments being performed by Swedish consultants under a number of framework agreements. In addition, Acando intends  to initiate a recruitment campaign in Sweden to better meet the needs of the Norwegian market.     The utilization rate in the Java area and for Microsoft-based solutions increased during the quarter after a weak start to the  year. The number of enquires in the Java area increased significantly based on the contracted framework agreements. Acando  has had continued success within membership solutions and, during the quarter, the Norwegian Choir Association signed an  agreement with Acando for the purchase and implementation of a new membership system based on Microsoft Dynamics.  Acando will also implement a new portal based on SharePoint 2013, and implement Office365.    Evidence of Acando’s ability to enable solutions with cloud-based delivery models was provided when Odin Capital signed an  agreement with Acando in Norway to build a cloud-based document management system with a high degree of flexibility and  scalability.     Other countries  Finland: Acando continued to expand its customer base in SAP and services linked to SAP-based solutions. In particular,  mobile solutions had a robust market and the offering for, among other things, field service was widened to include new  industries. Several large projects were initiated in the beginning of the year, which resulted in healthy utilization rates.    The UK: Operations in the UK trended favorably in the London area during the first quarter, but were slightly weaker in the  Manchester area. A number of projects were completed at AstraZeneca and were not fully compensated for. Growth was  primarily in the London region and the new customers established there in 2012 now account for more than 25 percent of total  sales.

The town  is located on Borðoy, which is one of the northernmost islands.  The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not  before the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern  Faroese town that became the cultural and commercial centre for the Northern  Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksvik is located between two inlets  lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a  modern fishing fleet.  With the opening of the sub sea tunnel, the  Norðoyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksvík is physically linked with the mainland of  the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports.    SUMMARY OF Q1 2013   MARKETS AND SALES   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   SEGMENT INFORMATION   GROUP FINANCIALS   INVESTMENTS   OUTLOOK  Page 4 BAKKAFROST / Q1 PRESENTATION 2013  BAKKAFROST   – THE LARGEST FISH FARMING COMPANY IN THE FAROE ISLANDS  ~1 10 km      Largest salmon farming company in the Faroe Islands   ~55% of harvest volumes in Q1 2013   50% of farming licenses     Harvested  8,296 tgw in Q1 2013 (11,348 tgw in Q1 2012)   Feed sale of 14,906 tonnes in Q1 2013* (15,299 tonnes in Q1 2012*)     Revenues of DKK 473 million in Q1 2013 (DKK 400 million in Q1 2012)   Operational EBIT of DKK 105 million in Q1 2013 (DKK 60 million in Q1 2012)   Positive results from Farming and Feed, loss on VAP     Dividend of DKK 2 per share (NOK~ 2.04) paid out in May 2013   Issued and listing of unsecured bonds amounting to NOK 500 million  *) Including internal sale of 10,991 tonnes in Q1 2013 ( 11,827 tonnes in Q1 2012).     Page 5 BAKKAFROST / Q1 PRESENTATION 2013  SUMMARY OF Q1 2013  Margin   Strong results - Operational EBIT DKK 105m   Farming EBIT/kg NOK 14.95   Fishmeal, Oil and Feed 15.75% EBITDA margin   VAP negative EBIT/kg of NOK 5.44  Market   Improved salmon prices on back of reduced supply   Supply drop estimated to 3 - 5% in Q1 2013 compared to Q1 2012    Operation   Volume reduction of harvested fish was 27% due to less availability of large  fish in Q1 2013   Smolt transfer in Q1 according to plan and on same level as last year   Biology good and stable

     INTERIM REPORT  1 January - 31 March 2015     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Financial Supervisory  Authority            1 (24)        INTERIM REPORT    FIRST QUARTER JANUARY 1 - MARCH 31, 2015   Net sales of SEK 557 m (401)   Operating profit SEK 46 m (27)    Operating margin 8.3% (6.7)   Profit after tax was SEK 29 m (21)   Earnings per share were SEK 0.28 (0.29)   Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 66 m (118)        Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The first quarter of 2015 recorded a favorable trend in terms of our aim of building Sweden and northern Europe’s most  modern consulting company. The collective capacity of the new Acando means we are perceived as a relevant partner  for larger transformation programs where technology’s possibilities combined with strategic understanding and  adaptable implementation strength are crucial for success. In parallel, the market is changing and, suddenly, digitization  is something that effects everyone and is becoming a fully integrated part of the strategy. Our experience of working  closely with customers enables us to inspire choices and guide implementation. A successful market position and  increased relevance with customers leads to financial results. In a stable market, an increasing operating margin and  growing profits were posted for the quarter. We are secure in the position we have taken and the ever increasing  opportunities that it entails. Accordingly, as previously announced, Acando’s Board has decided to recommend a  dividend of SEK 1.00 per share, in total about SEK 103 m, to our owners.   The operating margin is trending favorably in Sweden and is attributable to a rising utilization rate as well as the  efficiency enhancements implemented in 2014. Margins and earnings are also trending positively in Norway, driven by  continued success in the public sector as well as by investments in new growth areas.   We are strengthening our position as a relevant alternative in increasingly large business system projects and, together  with Ascom, we were entrusted with implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX in a global roll-out. In parallel, we have noted  that our cutting-edge offering and specialization areas in Digital and Management Consulting are generating results.   During the quarter, we won several key projects for efficiency enhancement and for creating new decision-support  possibilities, both by realizing new solutions and also through a strategic approach to needs analysis and information  structures. We have also won a project to implement support for intelligent transportation systems at a public agency  (route and traffic information). We are being entrusted with developing strategies that enable our customers to interact  with their customers in entirely new ways, both digitally and physically, we have initiated efforts with understanding  how the growth of a digital workforce and robotization will impact our customers and we have noted how the distance  between our most strategic assignments and implementation is shrinking.  We are not satisfied. Our goals stand firm. We will be the most modern consulting company and deliver sustainable  organic growth and an operating margin of 10 percent. To realize these goals, we are working with packaging our  solutions, higher relevance for a higher price, a cost-efficient delivery model with the right mix of offshore and  nearshore and accelerated recruitment of the most talented personnel. I note with pride that we are in the final phase  of recruitment to our next (our thirteenth) trainee program, which starts after the summer, with more ambitious  applicants than ever, and that we are now expanding the program to include both Malmö and Gothenburg.   INTERIM REPORT   1 January - 31 March 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (24)  www.acando.com  Significant events    First quarter, 2015  On February 1, 2015, Acando launched its updated brand profile, which is expected to lead to clearer positioning vis-à- vis competitors and increased attractiveness for employees.     On February 5, Acando received the Partner of the Year Award for Middleware, which is presented at an annual event  for Oracle’s partners in Sweden. Acando was awarded the distinction with the following commendation: “This partner  has been part of numerous major transactions during the year. Successful projects were brought to fruition through  solid competence and continued investment in Oracle MW.” Acando Norway received the corresponding award with the  commendation: “Acando is a Norwegian powerhouse in Middleware and service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the  initiative has now become Nordic. During the year, major breakthroughs have been made into the energy market.” The  merger between Acando and Connecta in autumn 2014, doubled the size of operations and, accordingly, the collective  Oracle skills were strengthened in several areas.     Acando has signed an agreement with Gunnebo to upgrade decision support and integrate it in a new version of the  Microsoft Dynamics business system. To avoid developing new decision support from the ground up, Acando’s IDW Darwin  concept and packaging is used, which is Acando’s framework for generating a complete data store in Microsoft SQL  Server based on metadata. This significantly shortens development times for data stores and ongoing further  development.    The launch of SAP S/4 HANA creates new possibilities in the SAP area. Acando has taken a leading position through an  intensive training and experience-building program.    Acando’s trainee program is expanding to include Gothenburg and Malmö. Over the past ten years, Connecta has run a  trainee program for consultancy talents in Stockholm and, through the merger of Connecta and Acando, possibilities  were opened for geographic expansion. Accordingly, in August, the Acando trainee program will start for the first time  in Gothenburg and Malmö. The objective is to continue supplementing the recruitment of experienced consultants with  younger, talented graduates.    Acando signed a framework agreement with Ascom Wireless Solutions regarding Microsoft Dynamics implementation and  administration services for the Ascom group companies.    In January, Acando divested its UK operations as part of its strategic focus on the core business areas of Management  Consulting, Business Systems and Digital Solutions. At the end of March, the Swedish operations divested Titan IT, whose  main operations comprised recruitment. The operations were not of significant importance to the Group and the  divestment increases possibilities for focusing on the geographic markets with favorable conditions for delivering  Acando’s entire offering.    Significant events after the end of the period  The Nordic region’s leading mail order company, the Ellos Group, chose Acando’s services and the Darwin framework  for developing tomorrow’s decision support. Darwin is both a method and a software that substantially reduces the  investment in development and the administration cost of data stores.    INTERIM REPORT   1 January - 31 March 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (24)  www.acando.com  Business activities          Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept, in partnership with its customers, is to create business value  by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,800 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and delivery centers in  India and Latvia.          Acando’s offering    Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in place to  be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing.     Acando is the only Swedish company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and  IT to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below. Application Services include support services contract with  recurring revenue.          INTERIM REPORT   1 January - 31 March 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (24)  www.acando.com  Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between segments. Acando continued  to strengthen its position in the retail segment during the quarter, with continued expansion at existing customers  through the delivery of several new service components. In the finance segment as well, particularly banking and  insurance, several new customers were added and rising demand were noted.  In the IT and telecoms area, a number of new projects were won in the operator segment, linked to both streamlining  and the strategic development of services in new areas. The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s  service portfolio and geographic spread makes it well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities and agencies. In  addition, an investment is ongoing in solutions for improved business support for municipalities.              Market development in the first quarter  Demand in Sweden remains healthy and on a par with the second half of 2014, albeit with certain geographical  differences where Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region are performing best. In Germany, the demand situation remains  normal, which was also the case for Norway. The weakest market is Finland, where it remains cautious and assignments  are both fewer and subject to intense competition. For 2015, demand is expected to continue in line with how it started.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, implementation and technology.              INTERIM REPORT   1 January - 31 March 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (24)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    First quarter January - March 2015  Net sales and operating profit before goodwill impairment (EBITA) for the first quarter of 2015 are shown in the table  below:      Consolidated net sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 557 m (401). EBITA was SEK 46 m (27), corresponding to a margin  of 8.3 percent (6.7).     The year-on-year strengthening in earnings for Sweden and Norway was attributable to a raised utilization rate.  The item Other countries includes Acando’s operations in Finland and the delivery centers in India and Latvia. During  the quarter, work was completed with the new brand platform, which contributed an increase in costs of SEK 1.5 m  over the norm under the item Group adjustments.     Consolidated profit after tax totaled SEK 29 m (21). The divestments of Acando’s UK operations and of Titan in  Sweden generated nonrecurring expenses under the Group’s net financial items of SEK 7 m. Earnings per share after  dilution amounted to SEK 0.28 (0.29).          Profit trend per quarter   The graph on the right shows net sales and operating  profit for the past four years.   In terms of work, the fourth quarter is the most work  intensive with the highest number of working days. The  third quarter is always lower due to vacation.  The industry in which Acando operates is late-cyclical  and a weak market impacts with a delay of about one  quarter.

The combined  farming and VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 216.8 million in Q1 2015. The Farming  segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 195.0 million. The global salmon spot prices decreased  during the quarter. Bakkafrost’s VAP segment had stable market conditions and made an operational  EBIT of DKK 21.9 million in Q1 2015. The EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 62.6 million in Q1 2015.     The Group made a profit for the quarter of DKK  132.4 million (DKK 87.2 million).     The total volumes harvested in Q1 2015 were 9,726  tonnes gutted weight (9,269 tgw) – an increase of  5%.    Bakkafrost transferred 2.2 million smolts in Q1 2015  (3.0 million), which is in line with the company’s  plans.     In accordance with the Group’s dividend policy,  Bakkafrost aims at giving its shareholders a  competitive return on their investment, both through  payment of dividends and by securing an increase  in the value of the equity through positive oper- ations. Bakkafrost’s financial position is strong with  a healthy balance sheet, a competitive operation  and undrawn available credit facilities. The Annual  General Meeting decided on the 11th of April 2015  to pay out DKK 6.00 (NOK 6.78) per share as  dividend for 2014. This corresponds to DKK 293.1  million (NOK 331.1 million).    In Q1 2015, the associated company P/F Faroe  Farming harvested 2,296 tonnes gutted weight  (2,166 tgw).     The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 216.8 million (DKK 176.7  million) in Q1 2015.    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 195.0 million (DKK 186.2 million) in Q1 2015.   The spot prices were lower in Q1 2015, compared  to Q1 2014. Bakkafrost achieved higher prices,  however, resulting in a better operational EBIT.    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 21.9 million (DKK -9.5 million) for Q1 2015.  There is normally a time lag between the changes  in the spot prices and the changes in the contract  prices. The contract prices have increased signific- antly from the level in Q1 2014. Therefore, the VAP  result for Q1 2015 has improved, compared to last  year.    The third segment – FOF (fishmeal, oil and feed),  made an operational EBITDA of DKK 62.6 million  (DKK 22.2 million) in Q1 2015. The increase in   EBITDA is primarily due to the low purchase prices  during the autumn last year.  In Q1 2015, Havsbrún sourced 75,003 tonnes of  raw material (44,159 tonnes).  The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 226.7 million at the end of Q1  2015 (DKK 232.7 million at year-end 2014) include- ing deposits and losses on financial deriveatives  relating to the interest bearing debt. Bakkafrost had  undrawn credit facilities of approximately DKK  970.8 million, of which DKK 17.8 million were re- stricted at the end of Q1 2015.  Bakkafrost’s equity ratio is 61%, compared with  60% at the end of 2014.

Operational EBIT in Q1 2015 was DKK 234.9 million  (DKK 185.5 million). Improved margins in VAP and  FOF segments in Q1 2015, compared with Q1 2014,  resulted in an improved overall operational EBIT  margin. All segments had a positive contribution in  Q1 2015, while the VAP segment had a negative  margin in Q1 2014.    A fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological  assets has been recognised in Q1 2015 amounting  to DKK -54.9 million (DKK -113.8 million). The  adjustment is due to lower salmon spot prices at the  end of Q1 2015, compared with the beginning of the  quarter.    No changes were made to the provisions of onerous  contracts in Q1 2015 (DKK 70.9 million), as no  contracts were onerous at the beginning and at the  end of the quarter.   In Q1 2015, there was a loss from associated com- panies amounting to DKK -2.9 million (DKK -7.1  million).     Net interests in Q1 2015 were DKK -10.9 million  (DKK -17.5 million), whereof a negative unrealised  exchange rate adjustment of DKK -17.5 million  related to the bond loan of NOK 500 million is  posted in Q1 2015.     Net taxes in Q1 2015 amounted to DKK -33.7 million  (DKK -30.8 million).     The result for Q1 2015 was DKK 132.4 million (DKK  87.2 million).

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2016     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Swedish Financial  Supervisory Authority      ___________________________________________________________________________________________________        1 (25)        INTERIM REPORT    FIRST QUARTER JANUARY 1 – MARCH 31, 2016   Net sales of SEK 527 m (557)   Operating profit SEK 34 m (46)    Operating margin 6.4% (8.3)   Operating profit excluding discontinued  operations was SEK 38 m, corresponding to an  operating margin of 7.2% (8.3)   Profit after tax was SEK 24 m (29)   Earnings per share were SEK 0.24 (0.28)   Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 78 m  (66)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In the first quarter of the year, we continued our development into becoming the first choice for digital transformation.  We have supplemented our strategy of offering understanding, insight and experience gained from strategic business  transformations and solution implementation with new skills in digital design and customer interaction.  2016 started with a continued favorable trend in both Norway and Germany with rising margins and increasing organic  growth. However, sales and operating profit in the first quarter were impacted by calendar effects, the influx of new  employees during the first part of the quarter in Sweden and a negative earnings impact from the discontinued  operations in India in the quarter. A broad customer base in Sweden with an increasing number of digitization-driven  projects, strong framework agreement positions in the public sector in Norway and long customer relationships with  industrial conglomerates in Germany provide us with an excellent base for continued growth, and we are proud to  propose a dividend of SEK 1.20 per share to the AGM, which is our highest dividend to date.  We have noted how the proportion of assignments with clear digital profiles is on the rise. We are winning new  assignments to drive digital maturity processes in customers’ organizations, to work with customer behavior analysis  based on data-driven methods and, not least, to create new opportunities through innovation and the application of  digital technology in new contexts. However, we can also see how our own history and experience will play a crucial  role in our success. Our ability to understand the overall perspective in terms of change, architecture and realization  methods, in combination with long-standing customer relationships and managing customers’ unique environments,  gives us a decisive position whereby we can offer rapid and sustainable results. New models require the adaptation of  basic skills, and our strong positions in areas such as supply chain design, business system optimization and  transformation management make us the given choice for the most complex changes. In 2016, we will escalate our  access to digital talent through continued recruitment of established specialist skills and digital talent through our  trainee program, and in parallel through the acquisition of specific skills areas when opportunities arise.  To continue improving profitability, it is crucial to keep winning project-based deliveries and increase the proportion  of packaging in parallel with continuously adapting the cost base. We will focus on our delivery center in Riga while we  dispose of our delivery center in India, to thereby better leverage Acando’s delivery centers in project assignments and  achieve well-integrated and cost-efficient deliveries. Riga is already well-integrated and the focus will be on growth  and access to digital talent. Given the structure and duration of projects in the business systems area, for continuity,  we will continue to utilize skills from the discontinued operations in India over a transitional period.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (25)  www.acando.com  Access to innovative environments and venues that create new possibilities is one of our greatest sources of inspiration  together with arenas where our employees’ talents can be developed to their full potential. We are therefore  particularly proud of the collaboration Acando has entered into with GU Ventures, an organization linked to the  University of Gothenburg that aims to utilize the benefits of research findings.         Significant events during and after the quarter      HEM, Halmstads Energi och Miljö AB (Halmstads energy and environment) has chosen Acando Insidan for planning,  analysis and control of its business operations. Acando Insidan is based on decision-support tools from Microsoft,  complemented with targeting and budgeting/forecasting from Stratsys and BizView, which are two well-established  companies in their respective fields. Packaging is particularly well-suited to municipal operations and the public sector,  but also works well for the private sector.    Acando and GU Ventures AB have started a new strategic partnership based on a shared interest in developing enterprise  in Gothenburg. The aim of the partnership is to promote long-term, viable enterprise in the region.     Acando aims to be the leader in its segment in northern Europe and, as part of focusing all operations to the EU, a  decision was taken in the quarter to sell the operations in India to the management of Acando’s delivery center in India.  The operations are not significant for the Group and Acando estimates that gathering all volumes into one unit will  generate economies of scale and that the proximity of outsourcing in Europe contributes actively to increased  profitability for these types of deliveries. The sale is conditional on the approval of Acando’s Annual General Meeting.        Business activities      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept, in partnership with its customers, is to create business value  by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,600 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and a delivery center  in Latvia.      INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (25)  www.acando.com  Acando’s offering    Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in place to  be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish company with a  sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions to be able to successfully  compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:    Management pertains to consulting services and accelerated implementation in connection with strategic change and  includes innovation and optimizing the use of technology as key elements of the offering. Disruptive business models,  enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and demand  for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.     Within Enterprise projects are driven based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems  are key to driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX  and SAP, with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle.  Continued efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s  move toward cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where  Acando has a favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.      Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are driven by a  combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on modern technology  and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly  growing areas.    Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.              INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (25)  www.acando.com  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.         Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both Sweden and Germany, and  with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway.     The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major full-service assignments with  several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted driven by  a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In combination with  regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many companies in the  sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments linked to leading transformation and the development of digital  services, particularly in Sweden and Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. Given historically low oil prices, a  declining propensity for investment has been noted in the oil and gas segment. Acando has extensive experience and a  strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy companies and a number of smaller local companies.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for efficiency,  32% 41% 17% 10% Shares of sales by offering Management Digital Enterprise Application Services  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – March 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (25)  www.acando.com  increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong position in Norway comprises the base for  continued expansion in terms of content and geographical coverage.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.  Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.                  Market trend in the first quarter  Demand in Sweden remained healthy and on a par with 2015, albeit with certain geographical differences where  Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region comprise growth areas. In Germany, the demand situation remained normal for  the quarter. The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with an  increasingly noticeable decline in the willingness to invest in oil-related sectors, thus resulting in increasing competition  for available assignments. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious. The assessment is that  the conditions and the trends noted at the end of 2015 will continue into 2016, however, uncertainty in the macro  environment could impact demand.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation, implementation and technology.     19% 5% 12% 27% 19% 11% 6% Share of sales by customer segment Retial Energy Telecom, IT, media and entertainment Industry Public authorities and agencies Banking, finance and insurance Healthcare

Harvested volumes were 10.9 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined farming and  VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 236.0 million. The farming segment made  an operational EBIT of DKK 260.8 million and the increased salmon spot prices had a positive  effect on the farming segment. The high salmon spot prices affected the VAP segment  negatively, and the VAP Segment made an operational EBIT of DKK -24.8 million. The  EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 69.0 million.      The Group made a profit for the first quarter 2016 of  DKK 213.3 million (DKK 132.4 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q1 2016 were 10,934  tonnes gutted weight (9,726 tgw).     Bakkafrost transferred 1.9 million smolts in Q1 2016  (2.2 million).     Bakkafrost aims at giving its shareholders a com- petitive return on their investment, both through  payment of dividends and by securing an increase in  the value of the equity through positive operations.  The Annual General Meeting convened on 8 April  2016 decided to pay out a dividend of DKK 8.25 per  share, corresponding to NOK 10.37 per share. The  total dividend of DKK 403.1 million (NOK 506.6 mil- lion) was paid out on 25 April 2016.    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 236.0 million (DKK 216.8  million) in Q1 2016.    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 260.8 million (DKK 195.0 million) in Q1 2016.  The harvested volumes are higher in Q1 2016, com- pared to Q1 2015, and the operational EBIT is like- wise higher.   The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  -24.8 million (DKK 21.9 million) for Q1 2016. The op- erational EBIT in the VAP segment decreased due to  higher prices on raw material in the quarter.     The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 69.0 million (DKK 62.6  million) in Q1 2016. This corresponds to an operation- al EBITDA margin of 24.0% (30.5%).     In Q1 2016, Havsbrún sourced 71,568 tonnes of raw  material (75,003 tonnes).    The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 217.8 million at the end of Q1 2016  (DKK 391.5 million at year-end 2015) including de- posits and losses on financial derivatives relating to  the interest bearing debt.    Bakkafrost had undrawn credit facilities of approxi- mately DKK 1,073.7 million, of which DKK 52.9 million  were restricted at the end of Q1 2016.    Bakkafrost’s equity ratio was 66% at 31 March 2016,  unchanged from the end of 2015. INTERIM REPORT FOR Q1 2016                  BAKKAFROST    |  4  |    ISSUED MAY 10th 2016     Financial Review  (Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year)      Income Statement The operating revenues amounted to DKK 904.6 mil- lion (DKK 613.2 million) in Q1 2016. Higher revenue  in Q1 2016, compared to Q1 2015 is due to higher   spot prices, higher harvested volumes and higher vol- umes of fishmeal sold.    Operational EBIT was DKK 253.6 million (DKK 234.9  million) in Q1 2016. The margins in the farming and  FOF segment are higher in Q1 2016, than Q1 2015,  while the margin in VAP is lower.     The fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological as- sets amounted to DKK 107.6 million (DKK -55.0  million) in Q1 2016. The adjustment is due to higher  salmon spot prices in the end of Q1 2016, compared  with the beginning of the quarter.    Provisions were made for onerous contracts of DKK   -60.0 million (DKK 0.0 million) in Q1 2016. The provi- sions for onerous contracts reflects the difficult mar- ket situation for the VAP segment. Since late 2015,  the salmon spot prices have increased relatively  much, and the contracts negotiated for the VAP prod- ucts do not reflect the same price increase. The pro- visions have been recognised due to the high salmon  price at the end of Q1 2016.     In Q1 2016, there was a profit from associated com- panies amounting to DKK 3.0 million (DKK -2.9 mil- lion).     Net interests in Q1 2016 were DKK -21.4 million (DKK  -10.9 million), whereof a negative unrealised ex- change rate adjustment of DKK 7.7 million, relating to  the bond loan of NOK 500 million, is posted in Q1  2016.     Net taxes in Q1 2016 amounted to DKK -47.1 million  (DKK -33.7 million). The Faroese Parliament changed  the taxes on salmon farming in the Faroe Islands in  December 2015. The tax changes are effective from  January 2016. The new revenue tax is not classified  as taxes, but is classified as costs and is included in  EBIT. The revenue tax amounted to DKK -22.6 million  (DKK 0 million).    The result for Q1 2016 was DKK 213.3 million (DKK  132.4 million).

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2017  Price-sensitive information that   has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (26)    Interim report    First quarter January 1 – March 31, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 621 m (527)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 75 m (34)   > The operating margin was 12.1% (6.4)  > Profit after tax was SEK 54 m (24)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.52 (0.24)  > Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 84 m (78)  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  Acando’s positive trend from 2016 continues with a strong start to 2017. Sales grew in all geographies by  a total of 18 percent after adjustment for discontinued operations and profits more than doubled year-on- year. Our ongoing efforts to optimize the capture of customers’ needs in terms of more complex  transformation projects and expert support for their own organizations contribute to better utilization of  resources. We are continuing to package solutions to achieve cost and implementation efficiency, one  example of which is Acando’s Digital Workplace. We continued to win new customers during the quarter  and, in parallel, were rewarded for our innovative packaging when Microsoft raised our partner status.  We increasingly find ourselves in situations where we are working in fully integrated teams, together with  our customers, on their core business development with both implementations as well as model and  concept development. It is becoming increasingly clear that the divide between understanding customers’  and users’ behavior, and adapting the application of digital technology is becoming a decisive competitive  issue for our customers. Our ability to support and drive issues throughout the flow, from strategic choices  to the solution design, complex transformations and moves, is unique, and we are proud of the confidence  shown in us by our customers — in terms of creating new opportunities, and in developing and managing  existing solutions. Experimenting in digital modern environments becomes a must and there is an important  purpose for Acando Digital Innovation Agency Itch.  To ensure we always remain relevant, we develop and expand our offerings geographically and  concurrently conduct focused skills development to build entirely new skills or further refine what we already  have. During the quarter, we expanded the operations of Acando’s digital innovation agency, Itch, to  Norway. We have also made significant investments in Advanced Analysis and Machine Learning, where  we have won our first assignments in the retail and healthcare segments. In Industrial IoT, we are building  a position as both an advisor and system integrator as the internet of things merges with traditional business  systems and analytics components. We have also noted strong demand in terms of information security  and compliance, not least linked to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where we have a  strong offering.  We continue to record successes in many of the industries where we can see that digitalization has a vital  role, such as, banking and finance, retail, healthcare and public administration. Our successes include  signing new framework agreements with Systembolaget and Region Skåne, and winning framework  agreements and a major delivery project with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (26)  Our drivers include not only our customers’ expectations and needs, but the stimulation and challenges  that each of us at Acando provide each other with on a daily basis. We are proud that Acando Germany  won the A Great Place to Work award, and that the Group has expanded by a further 54 talented employees  during the quarter. At the same time, we need many more who want to challenge and to be challenged.    Significant events during and after the quarter    On March 1, Acando Itch started operations in Norway.  Itch is a digital design and innovation agency that  was started by Acando in 2016 with one office in Stockholm and now another in Oslo. Based on user  experience and new innovative technology, Itch provides services ranging from consultancy and service  design, to visualization and prototyping.     Acando in Norway has won a framework agreement for the development and maintenance of the  Norwegian Food Safety Authority’s control system. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) has  awarded Acando, together with another partner as subcontractor, an agreement for the development and  maintenance of new control solutions in line with the agency’s objectives for the period until 2020. The Food  Safety Authority will undergo a major digitalization process and wants an overall view of future development  and administration of its new solutions. The key components for the agency are how users can best conduct  their work duties, protect data and system safety, as well as how this impacts the agency’s portfolio and  architecture. The agreement is valued at NOK 150–200 million and applies for an initial period of three  years and is maximized at six years.    During the quarter, Acando Sweden won a framework agreement with Systembolaget. The agreement  covers services for IT and business development, and applies to consulting support and digitalization and  IT architecture services. Acando’s business concept is, in partnership with its customers, to increase  business value by enhancing and streamlining processes, and unleashing creativity and collaboration in  organizations through new digital solutions and tools. The agreement applies for a two-year period with a  possibility to extend for a further year.    Acando has signed a framework agreement with Region Skåne (RS) for consulting services covering  operations, organization, production and financial control. The agreement covers four areas of consulting  services: Health and medical care, Technical medical services, Public transport and Other operations.  Acando has excellent capacity and specific know-how from extensive assignments in the health and  medical care sectors and from other county council operations linked, among other things, to digitalization,  e-health and innovation.    Acando has strengthened its position as one of the leading suppliers of Office365, Sharepoint Online and  Sharepoint Server through receiving gold status for “Collaboration and Content” and “Small and Midmarket  Cloud Solutions.” Over the last few years, Acando has delivered collaborative solutions based on Microsoft  Sharepoint, to several large customers. Many of the deliveries are based on the Acando Collaboration  Platform (ACP), which is a solution that provides customers with a flexible digital workplace. ACP is a  collaboration platform based on Sharepoint and Office 365, and can be adapted to different types of  corporate needs with the aid of the latest technology. Through achieving gold status for “Small and  Midmarket Cloud Solutions,” Acando has proved that it is a leading Office 365 supplier to the Norwegian  SME market.     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (26)    Acando Germany won Great Place to Work® awards in the competition’s “Best Employer in Germany 2017”  “Best Employer in ITC 2017” categories. This is a seal of quality for companies that offer their employees  a particularly attractive corporate culture. Acando achieved placings among the top employers in both  competitions the first time that it entered the competition.        Business activities      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept is, in partnership with its customers, to create  business value through innovation and by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital  solutions as well as products and services. We stand out due to our ability to combine skills in strategy and  business operations with sound technical expertise, insight into user behavior and deep understanding of  how organizations and change function.   Our customers come from every sector and include a mix of major global organizations as well as medium- sized regional companies. We operate in a Northern European market with offices in Sweden, Finland,  Norway, Germany and Latvia, and have a total of 1,700 employees.      Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through  a combination of all of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established  methods and tools are in place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the  project.  The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting  companies as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish  company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital  solutions to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project  implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:  Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are  driven by a combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based  on modern technology and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well- positioned in several of the most rapidly growing areas in terms of user-centric solutions and digital product  innovation as well as industrial transformation through digitalization. We are entering a new era, when work  processes are partially replaced or expanded with digital solutions, which means that IT is no longer just  business support, but also functions as an expansion or integrated part of our customers’ processes,  products, services and entire business. Acando’s digital innovation agency, Itch, is a key element in  developing Acando’s offering within digital services and product innovation.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (26)  Consulting is active in all major industries and offers in-depth expertise in Strategy, Operational Control,  Sales & Marketing, Supply Chain and Operations. Acando’s broad knowledge base and cross-functional  business teams ensure a holistic perspective and good understanding of the customers, which means that  we can offer innovative perspectives and solutions that add unexpected added value. Acando’s absolute  strength is the transformation process and its high speed of implementation.   Enterprise is the leading Swedish supplier of platform-related services on selected platforms: SAP and  Dynamics AX. Together with our customers, we ensure that maximum value is created from platform  investments. We combine extensive operational expertise and well-tried methodology with functional and  technical platform competence.       Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over  time, Acando aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and  delivered projects.      Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.         Customers and segments     Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for  long-term, stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different  segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business- development assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both  Sweden and Germany, and with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway.   The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction  and e-commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also drive the need for a more  flexible and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major  full-service assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and  Norway.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – March 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  5 (26)  In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been  noted that is driven by a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with  customers. In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured  transformation programs at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments  linked to leading the transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and  Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and  external factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more  highly integrated services aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms.  Given historically low oil prices, a declining propensity for investment has been noted in the oil and gas  segment. Acando has extensive experience and a strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest  energy companies and a number of smaller local companies.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make  it well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by  demands for efficiency, increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong  position in Norway comprises the base for continued expansion in terms of content and geographical  coverage.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused  on efficient information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of  digital interaction. Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the  segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using  standard platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater  value. The media and entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact  with consumers and professional operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.    See below for the share of sales by customer segment.

Harvested volumes were 13.2 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined farming and  VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 320.2 million. The farming segment made  an operational EBIT of DKK 373.2 million. The salmon spot prices continued in Q1 2017 on  a high level from 2016, which was positive for the farming segment. The VAP segment  realized higher prices, but is not matched by the high spot prices, and therefore the VAP  segment had negative margins in Q1 2017. The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK -53.0 million. The EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 45.1 million.      The Group made a profit for the first quarter 2017 of  DKK 79.0 million (DKK 213.3 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q1 2017 were 13,158  tonnes gutted weight (10,934 tgw).    Bakkafrost transferred 1.4 million smolts (1.9 million)  during Q1 2017.    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 320.2 million (DKK 236.0  million) in Q1 2017. The operational EBIT per kg in  Q1 2017 was DKK 24.33 (DKK 21.58), which corre- sponds to NOK 29.40 (NOK 27.55) for the combined  farming and VAP segments.    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 373.2 million (DKK 260.8 million) in Q1 2017.  The harvested volumes were higher, and the average  spot price was higher in Q1 2017, compared to Q1  2016.    Bakkafrost’s farming site A-73 Hvannasund Norður  has been under suspicion of pathogenic ISA-virus  since July 2016. The suspicion rose anew in January  2017, and Bakkafrost decided to harvest the two  cages, related to the suspicion. Medio March 2017,  Bakkafrost decided to harvest the whole site early as  a precautionary action. At the end of March 2017,  pathogenic ISA-virus at farming site A-73 Hvanna- sund Norður was confirmed. Bakkafrost decided to  accelerate the already started harvest. The harvest of  farming site A-73 Hvannasund Norður ended on 12  April 2017, and the average size of the harvested fish  was just below 3 kg gutted weight.     The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  -53.0 million (DKK -24.8 million) for Q1 2017.  Although the sales prices in the VAP segment have  increased, the VAP segment continued to have  negative results, primarily due to the high salmon spot  prices.     The new VAP factory at Glyvrar started production in  January 2017, and Q1 2017 was the first quarter  when both the harvest operation and the VAP produc- tion operated in the combined VAP/harvest factory at  Glyvrar. Simultaneously, the old VAP factories were  closed.     The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 45.1 million (DKK 69.0  million) for Q1 2017, and the EBITDA margin was  16.3% (24.0%).    Havsbrún sourced 106,567 tonnes (71,568 tonnes) of  raw material during Q1 2017.    The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 458.6 million at the end of Q1 2017  (DKK 635.3 million at year-end 2016) including de- posits and losses on financial derivatives relating to  the interest-bearing debt. Bakkafrost had undrawn  credit facilities of approximately DKK 826.4 million at  the end of Q1 2017.    Bakkafrost’s equity ratio was 65% at 31 March 2017,  compared to 66% at the end of 2016.    Bakkafrost aims at giving the shareholders a com- petitive return on their investment, both through  payments of dividends and by securing an increase  in the value of the equity through positive operations.  The long-term goal of the Board of Directors is that  30-50% of earnings per share shall be paid out as  dividend. The Annual General Meeting, convened on  7 April 2017, decided to pay out a dividend of DKK  8.70, corresponding to NOK 10.69 per share. The  total dividend of DKK 425.1 million (NOK 522.5  million) was paid out on 21 April 2017.  INTERIM REPORT FOR Q1 2017                  BAKKAFROST    |  4  |    ISSUED MAY 23rd, 2017     Financial Review  (Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year)      Income Statement The operating revenues amounted to DKK 853.7  million (DKK 904.6 million) in Q1 2017. The revenue  decreased because of lower external revenue in the  FOF segment in Q1 2017, compared to Q1 2016. The  farming segment had higher volumes sold in this  quarter, compared to same quarter last year, but the  accelerated harvest of the site, which was suspected  for ISA and later confirmed, had a negative impact on  revenue per kg harvested fish.    Operational EBIT was DKK 335.5 million (DKK 253.6  million) in Q1 2017. The improvement in the oper- ational EBIT was especially related to the improved  operational EBIT in the farming segment in Q1 2017,  compared to Q1 2016. The operational EBIT in both  the FOF segment and VAP segment was lower in Q1  2017 than in Q1 2016.    The fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological  assets amounted to DKK -234.6 million (DKK 107.6  million) in Q1 2017. The negative adjustment is due  to lower market prices for salmon at the end of the  quarter, compared to the beginning of the quarter.  From Q1 2017, Bakkafrost has applied a new  calculation model for the fair value of the biological  assets. Bakkafrost has previously used the so-called  growth model, which has been the standard model in  the salmon industry to calculate the fair value of the  biomass. The new calculation model is a cash flow  model (present value model) and reference is made  to Note 4 for further information regarding the fair  value of the biomass and the change of calculation  model.    Change in provisions for onerous contracts amounted  to DKK 30.1 million (DKK -60.0 million) in Q1 2017.  The positive adjustment in provisions for onerous  contracts is due to the lower expected future salmon  prices at the end of Q1 2017.    In Q1 2017, there was a profit from associated  companies amounting to DKK 2.3 million (DKK 3.1  million).    The revenue tax in Q1 2017 amounted to DKK -30.2  million (DKK -22.6 million). The revenue tax in- creased because of higher harvested volumes in Q1  2017, compared to same quarter last year.     Net interests in Q1 2017 were DKK -6.3 million (DKK  -21.4 million), whereof an unrealized exchange rate  adjustment of DKK 3.5 million (DKK -7.7 million),  relating to the bond loan of NOK 500 million, is posted  in Q1 2017.    Net taxes amounted to DKK -17.7 million (DKK -47.1  million) in Q1 2017.     The result for Q1 2017 was DKK 79.0 million (DKK  213.3 million).      79 million DKK   Result for Q1 2017

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1–March 31, 2018  Price-sensitive information that   has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (24)  Interim report    First quarter January 1–March 31, 2018  > Net sales totaled SEK 703 m (621)  > Operating profit SEK 76 m (75) Operating  profit before non-recurring items SEK 80 m     > Operating margin 11% (12)  > Profit after tax was SEK 59 m (54)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.56 (0.52)  > Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 44  m (84)                  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In many ways, 2018 started the same way that 2017 ended. Demand for Acando’s services remained strong  in a market driven by demand for innovation, increased data-driven customer insight and, especially, by  extremely high activity in terms of using technology to realize completely new possibilities for efficiency.  Our position in such transformation-driven segments as retail, the public sector and manufacturing  generates new opportunities on a daily basis.  We are continuing to grow with sustained profitability in a  strong market. We grew 13 percent year-on-year and earnings are up slightly more than 6 percent.   During the quarter, we completed the establishment of several new operational activities in new  geographies to thereby continue to develop and adapt our offering to the fastest-growing market sectors.   The acquisition of Anywhere.24 in Germany, which was completed on January 1, 2018, fully established  Acando’s already strong Dynamics 365 operations across Germany. The area is one of Acando’s fastest  growing and by collaboration across national borders, we expect to also capture a leading position in the  German market.   In 2017, Acando acquired the service-design agencies Transformator Design and Daytona. Together with  two of Acando’s units, the agencies have now been integrated under the itch brand. The itch brand has  already been established as Acando’s own innovation agency and, going forward, it will become Sweden’s  largest business design and development studio. Essentially, Acando’s business is based on creating  unforgettable customer experiences. We have been particularly good at delivering the above in relation to  our customers — now we want to come closer to the end customer experience. Unifying our agencies’  extensive expertise under the itch brand will be a natural part of continuing to deliver impact and value  across the chain. Itch currently has 160 employees and the studio is represented in Stockholm, Gothenburg,  Malmö and Oslo. There is also some representation in Germany and further expansion plans for Europe.  2018 started with exciting projects, many new employees and a strong sense of being very central for our  customers. The only certainty is that we will continue to develop and our ability to change in pace with our  operating environment will be decisive to our success. We believe the world will increasingly be driven by  technology but that understanding human behavior will always be key to creating the best solutions. It’s  what we are — Technology Driven and Behavior Centric.      INTERIM REPORT  January 1–March 31, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (24)  Significant events during and after the quarter  Transformator Design, which is now part of Acando’s Business Design Studio under the itch brand, has  been nominated in Design S – Swedish Design Awards, for a project designing the reuse and recycling  centers of tomorrow. The prize, Sweden’s foremost design award, is aimed at professional designers,  architects, individuals, producers and companies that work with design.  The nominated project was  conducted on behalf of SÖRAB, a regional waste disposal company owned by ten municipalities in the  Stockholm area, and aims to develop and construct a new, highly functional reuse and recycling center.  Unlike recycling centers, reuse and recycling centers allow customers to bring items for reuse and for  recycling.   Acando has prepared a solution, based on Dynamics CRM, which simplifies the donation and collection  process for a charitable organization. The charitable organization supports aid projects for refugees and  needed to optimize and streamline its donation processes to meet its strategic goals. Acando will also  provide support and maintenance for the system, thus enabling the charitable organization to keep track of  who donates and which sponsors suit the various aid projects. With the help of data and insights regarding  the donations, the organization can build long-term relationships with its donors.  Acando has been given the assignment to implement the SAP S/4 HANA ERP system at BAE Systems.  The new platform creates the preconditions for efficient, shared solutions and processes for BAE Systems  in Sweden, and lowers total IT costs. A shared SAP S/4 HANA system for BAE Systems in Sweden is being  established to realize the cost savings and achieve a full return on these investments in the company’s  ERP environments.  Acando has been tasked with working with data-driven customer insights for end customers on behalf of a  leading global manufacturer of industrial material. Increased awareness of end customers’ needs and  buying patterns enable Acando to improve the customer dialogue with selected distributors. The project  background is that the industrial company had identified a need to understand the behavior of small and  mid-sized customers when making purchases through the distributor channel. The project entails sharing  customer data between distributors and the manufacturer, which leads to enhanced dialogue and planning.  Within the framework of this project, Acando has advised the manufacturer but also acted as guarantor for  the confidentiality of any data aggregated and managed.  After the end of the period, on 25 April, on the back of the authorization from the 2017 AGM, the Board  decided to make a new share issue and immediately thereafter, to buy back 900,000 Series C shares. This  was carried out through a private placement for cash of 900,000 Series C shares to the Swedish branch of  Danske Bank A/S, Denmark. The subscription price for the shares is SEK 1.3792 per share, which  corresponds to its quotient value. Moreover, the Board has decided to immediately buy back all 900,000  Series C shares from the Swedish branch of Danske Bank A/S, Denmark at a price corresponding to the  subscription price. The aim of the issue and buy back of Series C shares is, following conversion to Series  B shares, to secure the provision of Series B shares to Group employees participating in the 2017 share- savings program adopted at the AGM on May 4, 2017. The allocation of shares under the 2017 share- savings program will take place in August 2020.         INTERIM REPORT  January 1–March 31, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (24)  Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and  human behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change.

Over  time, Acando aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and  delivered projects.        INTERIM REPORT  January 1–March 31, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (24)  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.         Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for  long-term, stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different  segments.      Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business- development assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both  Sweden and Germany, and with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway. A high level of  innovation and efficiency enhancement in traditional industrial companies is enabled by digital capabilities  in product content, business models and processes. Acando is well-positioned to create completely new  possibilities in the segment, together with its customers, through a combination of transformative  implementations and deep technical expertise.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction  and e-commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also create the need for a  more flexible and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has  major full-service assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany  and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been  noted as a result of the need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with  customers. In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured  transformation programs at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments  linked to leading the transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and  Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and  external factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more  highly integrated services aimed at customers are increasing the need for more advanced digital platforms.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–March 31, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  5 (24)  Acando has extensive experience and a strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy  companies as well as a number of smaller local companies.  The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make  it well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by  demands for efficiency, increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong  position in Norway comprises the base for continued expansion in terms of content and geographical  coverage.    The healthcare segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused  on efficient information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of  digital interaction. Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the  segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using  standard platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater  value. The media and entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact  with consumers and professional operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.    See below for the share of sales by customer segment.        First quarter market trend    Demand remained healthy in Sweden through the start of 2018. All regions in Sweden trended positively,  primarily driven by the increasing need for digitalization. In Germany, demand remained normal during the  period. The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with  increased willingness to invest in the offshore and oil industry with a consequent recovery in oil-related  sectors.  Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation, digital content in products and services, and completely new application areas for  technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become crucial to create clear links between strategy,  innovation, implementation, user behavior and technology.

Any effects from business combinations are not included. For details, see below.  ** CAPEX is defined as investments in intangible, tangible and financial assets as reported in the statement of cash flows.    CEO’s statement    As mentioned in the Q4 2015 report, the sales rate following last year’s launch of our consumer  smartphone proposition suggests that Norwegian consumers find ice.net’s product attractive and  competitive. This impression has recently been bolstered by two leading Norwegian consumer technology  websites which both have labelled ice.net’s mobile phone subscriptions as “best value for money”.    The strong sales momentum has continued throughout the first quarter and into the second quarter. In  April and May alone, ice.net’s gross subscriber sales totalled more than 50,000. This confirms that the  strategy of operating as an open and honest provider, with no hidden fees or costs, resonates well with  Norwegian consumers.    As communicated in the Q4 2015 report, we experienced churn within the Network Norway B2B portfolio  in 2015 and this continues to affect year-on-year revenues growth negatively for the group. The positive  development within B2B has continued and we are now experiencing more normalised churn levels. Later  this year, the Network Norway year-on-year benchmarks will become more benign as the strongest churn  was experienced in Q2 and Q3 2015 – the period affected by the migration from Telenor’s network.  Furthermore, with the strong sales momentum within B2C, the revenue growth trend in Norway is  expected to improve further during the course of the year.    The fine-tuning of our 4G mobile broadband networks is ongoing throughout our Scandinavian markets,  leading to better quality of service. In January, ice.net met the Norwegian government’s 800 MHz  frequency coverage requirement of 40% of the population – two years ahead of the deadline. However,  the pace of the network roll-out will be maintained and we will increase our footprint significantly by the  end of the year.     The board remains very supportive of the continued investment in customer acquisition and network roll- out in Norway.    The management is very satisfied with the improvement of results in Sweden, with profitability at a level  that has not been seen before. Net1 in Sweden is also experiencing increased interest in wholesale  partnerships and B2B data connections and services following our network upgrade to 4G.    AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  First Quarter 2016  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (10)  Significant events during the first quarter     Fine-tuning and optimization of the new 4G mobile broadband networks was finalised during the  first quarter 2016.   Officer AS and Drammen Tele AS were merged into Ice Communication Norge AS.    Significant events after the end of the period     Phil Hewinson, Facebook’s head of third-party mobile app monetization in Europe, Middle East  and Africa, joins the board of directors of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS’s parent company,  AINMT Holdings AB.    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 151 versus 136 for the equivalent period  the previous year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and  subcontractors, the Group employed 249 (158) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible assets during the first quarter amounted to NOK 3,034 (36,100)  thousands. Investments in tangible assets amounted to NOK 102,436 (79,252). The investments are  mainly related to the network smartphone migration project in Norway, both on existing and new sites as  well as on backbone systems.    Financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK 1,120 (12,800) thousands (deposits).    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the first quarter amounts to NOK 10,948 (7,838) thousands. Non- recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade.     For the 2015 numbers, the NOK 94.6 million net positive effect from the acquisition of Network Norway is  not included in the EBITDA.    Risks and factors of uncertainty    AINMT Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings  or its financial position. These can be divided into industry, operational and financial risks; including  regulatory and competitive risks.    A material part of the Group’s revenues and profits is derived from operations outside Norway. Currency  fluctuations may influence the reported figures in Norwegian Kroner to an increasing extent.  Please refer to the annual report of 2015 for a detailed walk-through of the risks identified.    Related party transactions    No related party transactions to report for the first quarter of 2016.

                                                        AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS    Quarterly Report  January – March 2017      AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  First Quarter 2017  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 1 (9)  FIRST QUARTER 2017 SUMMARY    - Service revenue of NOK 280,052 thousand; 55% y-o-y growth  - EBITDA* of NOK -98,464 thousand  - Book equity of NOK 1,186,236 thousand        CEO’s statement    The main highlight of the first quarter 2017 was the increased revenue growth driven by strong B2C  smartphone momentum in Norway. Over the last three quarters the y-o-y service revenue growth for AINMT  Scandinavia Holdings AS has steadily increased to now 55% in Q1 2017 vs 20% for FY2016. Even though the  service revenues grew 55% y-o-y, the introduction to EU-roaming price plans was introduced late in Q117  and most of the positive effect of the change did not occur in this quarter, but will fully materialize by end of  Q217. We continue to make progress regarding our network build-out, Q1 saw an average smartphone on-net  traffic of 13% and we’re confident in reaching our on-net share targets in the following quarters.    Another major event for AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS was the refinancing we completed in March. The  new financing solution strengthens the company’s financial position and significantly reduces our annual  financial costs. The new NOK 1.4 billion secured bank facilities underwritten by DNB Bank ASA and NOK 800  million senior unsecured bond were announced in March and subsequently signed and allocated on 7 April.  The proceeds of the refinancing has since been used to part-finance the full redemption of our SEK 1.5 billion  bond, which was issued in March 2014. Today, we have been through a major transformation including  completing the 4G swap and migration to our own platform for smartphone subscribers, which is reflected in  significantly lower interest rates for the new financing package. We have reduced the interest costs from  9.75% in the SEK 1.5 billion bond to a blended debt financing cost of NIBOR +4.80% across the underwritten  secured bank facilities and the new bond issue at the point of the refinancing. This will yield significant  increased flexibility for us going forward.    In Norway, ice.net continues to operate as an innovative player that want to challenge both the traditional  telecoms industry and the lucrative mobile phone duopoly of Telenor and Telia. Ice.net was the first company  to launch data roll-over to all its mobile phone consumer customers – a move that was extremely well  received amongst its current customer base. It also drove additional sales. All other Norwegian mobile phone  operators have since followed suit. Since then, ice.net has also included data roll-over for its B2B as well as  mobile broadband customers, making it the only company in Norway to offer data roll-over to all of it’s  customers.

For details, see below. AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  First Quarter 2017  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (9)  In March, ice.net introduced EU roaming to all its mobile phone subscriptions and customers. Prices were  adjusted accordingly, but this has not generated significant churn. ice.net’s strategy of operating openly and  honestly, with easy-to-understand subscription packages without any hidden fees, has struck a chord with  Norwegian consumers. The company will continue to build on this successful position to further differentiate  itself from other operators.    Significant events during the period    • On 3 February 2017, ice.net in Norway announced that it in March would launch data roll-over for all  mobile phone consumer customers. On 23 February, the offer was extended to B2B customers as  well, effective from April. Ice.net was the first operator in Norway to introduce the roll over concept,  which effectively allows customers to transfer any leftover data from their current bundle (up to a  certain cap) to the following month.  • The remaining NOK 200 million of the NOK 400 million shareholder loan granted by AINMT Holdings  AB to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS in December 2016 was disbursed in January 2017.   • On 8 March, the company announced a NOK 1.4 billion underwritten bank facilities with DNB Bank  ASA (subject to certain conditions precedent), comprising of senior secured facilities of NOK 800  million and an additional underwritten facility of NOK 600 million.  • On 9 March 2017, the company successfully completed the placement of a new five-year NOK 800  million senior unsecured bond issue. The placement was significantly oversubscribed.  • Prior to closing of the above-mentioned bank facilities and bond issue, AINMT Holdings AB  committed to inject NOK 830 million in equity or sub-ordinated loans into AINMT Scandinavia  Holdings AS. This figure includes an amount of NOK 400 million already contributed as a  subordinated loan into Scandinavia following the NOK 800 million AINMT AS share issue in Q4 2016.   • The company also announced that it would issue a notice of early redemption for the outstanding  SEK 1.5 billion senior secured bonds maturing in March 2019 (ISIN NO 0010705601).    Significant events after the end of the period    • On 7 April 2017, AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS announced the successful signing and completion  of both the NOK 1.4 billion secured bank facilities and the five-year NOK 800 million senior  unsecured bond issue. The debt facility consists of a NOK 200 million four-year term loan A, NOK 600  million five-year term loan B and a NOK 600 million five-year term loan C (growth) facility, paying  N+425bps, N+475bps and N+450bps, respectively with a ratchet that leads to lower interest margin  once certain milestones have been passed. The debt package also includes a five-year NOK 800  million unsecured bond paying N+525bps, which closes simultaneously with the debt facility. The  proceeds of the refinancing will be used to part-finance the full redemption of the existing SEK 1.5  billion bond and for general corporate purposes.  • On 21 April 2017, the company issued the call notice and redemption of the SEK 1.5 billion bond with  ticker AINMT01.

In Q1 2014 the CAPEX includes the newly acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    AINMT’s existing strategy has been focused on strengthening its position in the Scandinavian dedicated  mobile broadband market by utilising the advantages of the 450 MHz low-frequency spectrum, providing  the unbeatable coverage that suits the Scandinavian topography well.    The December 2013 frequency auction in Norway provided a unique opportunity for the Group to acquire  a significant amount of spectrum. The combination of 1) ever growing demand for data capacity, 2) highly  efficient new technology and 3) having no legacy to support, will allow the AINMT Group to build a state- of-the-art network able to address this demand. In Norway, ice.net will have the best coverage on  dedicated mobile broadband where the 450 MHz frequency is used in combination with 800, 900 and  1,800 MHz. By combining the frequencies, the Group now has more flexibility to invest in infrastructure to  support more capacity when needed.    In Sweden and Denmark the Group will continue to focus on the complementary aspects of the 450 MHz  frequency band, coverage, redundancy (2nd line) given the importance nowadays for customers to have  access to the internet and capacity (in urban areas).    Q1 is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter in terms of subscriber intake and top-up of user driven data  packages. Q1 2014 was no exception and Easter which normally drives subscriber growth and usage also  occurred in April this year (vs March in 2013). The continued positive EBITDA development of the group  is very encouraging even when accounting for the higher license fees in Norway    Following of the purchase of the additional frequencies in Norway in December 2013, the Group was able  to successfully raise a SEK 1.5 billion high yield bond in Q1 this year and preparations for selection of  vendor(s) for the network rollout is well underway.       AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  First Quarter 2014  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354      Quarterly Report 2014  Page 2  Significant events during the period    During the first quarter 2014 the AINMT Group, through AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS, successfully  issued a High Yield Bond. The bond (ISIN NO 001 0705601) was placed in SEK with the amount of 1.5  billion at 9.75% interest rate with semi-annual interest payments. Settlement date was 19 March 2014;  maturity date is 19 March 2019 (for further details on the bond, please visit our website www.ainmt.com  and investor relations) The proceeds from the bond have initially been used to repay previous external  loans and the company is left with a strong cash position to fund growth.    In connection to the bond issue, AINMT Holdings AB transferred its Scandinavian subsidiaries to AINMT  Scandinavia Holdings AS.    For further details on the bond, please visit our website www.ainmt.com and investor relations.    Significant events after the end of the period    The Group is in active discussions with a number of vendors who have positively responded to its RFQ. In  Norway, the company was able to secure new premises to cope with the planned increase in headcount  and the recruiting process is going well with a number of key hires already made.    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 82 versus 72 for the previous year.  Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, the  Group employed 99 (85) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible assets amounted to kNOK 715,589 (0) during the first quarter of the  year, including the acquisition of Ice Communication Norge AS that was awarded the spectrum licences in  Norway in December 2013, while investments in tangible assets amounted to kNOK 10,206 (18,254).    Investments in intangible assets consist of frequency spectrum licences and capitalised costs for research  and development. Investments in tangible assets are primarily related to network capacity expansions,  both on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the period amounts to kNOK 4,193 (192), related to inventory  revaluations and restructuring.

In 2014 the Jan-Mar CAPEX includes the acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    The first quarter of 2015 represents a major milestone in AINMT’s history. On 5 February 2015, the  Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Tele2’s Norwegian operation.  Consequently, the acquisition of Network Norway and a national roaming agreement with TeliaSonera –  came into effect to help strengthen AINMT’s Norwegian operation’s competitive position in Norway.      As a result, from 1 March 2015 we started operating as a smartphone player in Norway. The successful  migration of Network Norway’s customer base from Telenor to TeliaSonera’s network was also completed  during March 2015.    Subsequent to the quarter, and as another consequence of the above-mentioned Norwegian Competition  Authority-approval, Ice Communication Norge AS’ agreement to acquire most of Tele2’s mobile network  infrastructure, including the Oslo underground system and Oslo Airport, came into effect on 1 April 2015.  In a relatively short space of time, Ice has developed from being a pure-play provider of mobile broadband  services to becoming Norway’s third largest mobile network operator    The network upgrade throughout Scandinavia is progressing well and we have started communicating  with all our customers, the feedback received is positive. We anticipate this to be finalised by October  2015.      Our first quarter results have been positively impacted by the lease of spectrum to Mobile Norway and  also the impact of adding Network Norway’s customer base and operation for the month of March. We  expect the group’s revenues to continue to increase on a quarterly basis given the increased sales  activities we will undertake in the coming months.     AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  First Quarter 2015  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (11)  Significant events during the first quarter    On 5 February 2015, the Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Tele2’s  Norwegian operation.

The total negative effect of these significant one-offs and reconciliation items in 2018 vs 2017  was NOK 29 million.         CEO’s statement    For ice group’s Scandinavian operation, service revenues in the first quarter 2018 increased with 28% compared with  the corresponding quarter in 2017.    To date, ice in Norway has in 2018 increased its footprint with approximately 500 new active base stations, bringing  the total close to 1,800 which gives a population coverage of 80%, a target that was achieved ahead of schedule. The  new base stations operate in the 800, 900 and 1,800 MHz frequency bands. As a result, the average smartphone on- net data traffic increased from 31% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 41% in the first quarter of 2018.     Subsequent to the quarter, on 3 May 2018, another important milestone was met when ice group’s Norwegian operation  entered into a new and improved national roaming agreement (NRA) with Telia in Norway. The new NRA is valid for  two years, with an additional and conditional right to prolong the NRA for one year. While the financial details of the  agreement remain confidential, the new agreement offers favourable conditions and, more importantly, a higher level  of flexibility for ice.     In total, the first quarter presented improved operational performance in Norway for a number of parameters. Both  smartphone ARPU and blended ARPU (smartphone and mobile broadband) showed an increase in Q1 2018 versus  Q4 2017, while blended churn decreased in the same period. Subsequent to the quarter, on 23 May, ice announced  that it had reached a total of 500,000 customers, including mobile voice and data as well as mobile broadband  customers, confirming its challenger position in the Norwegian telecom market.    While Norway continues to the major activity hub for ice group in Scandinavia, a key highlight in the first quarter was  related to Sweden. On 6 February 2018, ice group’s Swedish operation (Net1) won the Swedish Post and Telecom  Authority’s frequency auction for the national license of 2 x 5 MHz in the 450 MHz band. The term of license is from 5  March 2020 up to and including 31 December 2044. Obtaining the license until 2044 provides the required foundation  to continue developing ice group’s mobile broadband offering in Sweden and continue its expansion in the machine- to-machine market.

See page 8 for more information. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 2018                2  The EBITDA in the quarter was weakened by several one-offs and reconciliation items in January and February  compared to Q1 2017. These include extraordinary marketing cost because of the rebranding from ice.net to ice, a  compensation from a supplier in Q1 2017, a smaller effect of the IFRS capitalization in 2018 vs 2017 and double office  rent in Norway due to change of location late in 2017. The total negative effect of these significant one-offs and  reconciliation items in 2018 vs 2017 was NOK 29 million.     Significant events during the period  ⁎ On 6 February 2018, ice group’s Swedish operation (Net1) won the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority’s  frequency auction for the national license of 2 x 5 MHz in the 450 MHz band. The term of license is from 5  March 2020 up to and including 31 December 2044. Obtaining the license until 2044 provides the required  foundation to continue developing ice group’s mobile broadband offering in Sweden and continue its  expansion in the machine-to-machine market. Net1 paid SEK 40 million for the licenses, equal to Telia’s bid  in the auction.    Significant events after the end of the period  ⁎ On 3 May 2018, ice group’s Norwegian operation has entered into a new and improved national roaming  agreement (NRA) with Telia in Norway. The new NRA is valid for two years starting from March 1, 2018, with  an additional and conditional right to prolong the NRA for one year. The financial details of the agreement  remain confidential. The new agreement offers favourable conditions and, more importantly, a higher level of  flexibility for ice. The new NRA replaces the three-year agreement (plus an optional three-year period) ice and  Telia in Norway signed in February 2015. The NRA includes voice and data services on Telia’s 2G, 3G and  4G networks for all ice customers in Norway.   ⁎ In May 2018, network build-out in Norway reached 80% population coverage.  ⁎ On 23 May 2018, ice announced that it had reached 500,000 customers (415,000 mobile voice and data  customers, plus 85,000 mobile broadband customers), confirming its challenger position in the Norwegian  telecom market.    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 196 versus 170 for the equivalent period the previous  year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, the Group  employed 284 (266) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible and tangible assets during the first quarter amounted to NOK -186,269 (-278,093)  thousands. The investments are mainly related to the network smartphone build-out project in Norway, both on existing  and new sites as well as on backbone systems and radio access network expansion, costs to obtain and fulfil customer  contracts and also the 450 Mhz license in Sweden.    As from 1 January 2018, ice group capitalizes costs to obtain and to fulfil customer contracts, which means that these  items are now recognized as investment expenditures instead of as previously as operating expenditures. As the  change of principle is applied retrospectively, the impact on the first quarter of 2017 investments were NOK 41,498  thousands while this quarters investment in new customers amounted to NOK 46,626 thousands. These are included  in the amounts above.    Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK -116 (2,906) thousands.    EBITDA    Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the first quarter amounted to NOK 4,650 (13,409)  thousands. Non-recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade  and build-out. Please also see the Alternative Performance Measures reconciliation on page 10.    The implementation of the IFRS 15 reporting standard from 1 January 2018 has changed how and when certain  revenue and cost items are recognized, which has impact on ice group’s EBITDA. The effect from the new standard  FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 2018                3  on our EBITDA compared to previously applied principles for the first quarter 2017 amounted to NOK 17,883  thousands. More information is presented under the New and changed accounting standards in 2018 section, page 8.    Reclassification of commission revenue    Since the purchase of Network Norway business customers in March 2015, commission revenue and related expenses  have been recorded gross within service revenue and operating expenses, in line with the accounting in Network  Norway prior to being acquired by ice. Ice has decided to change the accounting principle and instead recognise the  commission revenue net of expenses. The accumulated revenue impact for the first quarter 2017 amounts to NOK - 7,500 (-2,880) thousands. EBITDA and Net Result are not affected by this change. All comparative numbers have been  updated to reflect the change. See more information on page 8.    Risks and factors of uncertainty    Ice group Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings or its  financial position. These can be divided into industry, operational and financial risks; including regulatory and  competitive risks.    A material part of the ice group’s revenues and profits is derived from operations outside Norway. Currency fluctuations  may influence the reported figures in NOK. Please refer to the annual report of 2017 for a detailed description of the  risks identified.    Related party transactions    No related party transactions to report for the first quarter of 2018. For other items, see further details under the section  on critical accounting estimates and judgements in the annual report of 2017.    Outlook 2018    The Group expects to increase its mobile phone (smartphone) market share in Norway.

InterIm report Q1 /2014 Q1 reStAmAX InterIm FInAnCIAL  report Q1 2014 turnover grew by 4.8 per Cent And proFItAbILIty Improved   In JAnuAry-mArCh 2014 January-March 2014 in brief Figures in  parentheses refer to the same period  last year, unless otherwise stated. Group turnover was MEUR 15.9 (MEUR 15.2),  growth of 4.8 per cent. EBITDA was MEUR 1.4  (MEUR 1.3), growth of 12.9 per cent. Operating  profit was TEUR 87 (TEUR -23).  The EBITDA includes a non-recurring expense of  approximately MEUR 0.3 of the business transac- tions made during Q1 2014. Prospects for 2014  Profit guidance (unchanged since 5 March 2014): Restamax estimates that the 2014 turnover will  increase to MEUR 86-97. The company estimates  that the 2014 EBITDA will increase to MEUR 14.5- 16.3 and the operating profit to MEUR 8.7-10.4. The company’s goal is to reach a turnover of  MEUR 100 by the end of 2015. With the purchase  of the Rengasravintolat Group during the first  quarter of 2014, the company estimates it will  come close to meeting this goal already in 2014. In November 2013, Restamax became the first  Finnish listed restaurant company. Our growth  speed in 2013 was slightly calmer than in the  previous years, as the company concentrated on  the listing project. The first quarter of 2014 has  shown that the year will once again be one of  growth for Restamax. The listing, which supports our growth strat- egy, and the related share issue make possi- ble investments that will bring us significant  competitive advantage in future. A significant  amount of these investments will be realised  during 2014 and 2015. The stock exchange listing yielded capital  of MEUR 15.5 for growth. Investments were  started immediately, and 2014 also began under  strong conditions of growth. In January 2014,  together with Hans Välimäki Restamax estab- lished Gastromax Oy, which includes the Midhill  restaurants located in Helsinki and Tampere.  In March, the company opened the Masu Asian  Bistro in Tampere and, in Helsinki, new launch- es are being carried out in the second quarter of  2014.    In March, Restamax also made the largest  business transaction in its history by acquiring  the Rengasravintolat Group. As a result of the  acquisition, 16 new restaurants were transferred  to our portfolio. The transaction also helped us  strengthen our position in the Helsinki region  and we expanded our operations to the new  market area of Pori.  Ceo mArKKu vIrtAnen: continues on next page Q1 Ever since the company’s inception, our objec- tive has been to grow the business rapidly and  boldly. We have aimed to offer individual restau- rant services to different customers. We are on  the right track. Now, at the beginning of 2014,  our group comprises more than 80 restaurants  all over Finland: nightclubs, restaurants, pubs  and cafés.  Restamax’s approach aims to develop a range of  restaurant concepts to meet local demand. Our  extensive restaurant portfolio based on almost  40 different concepts, enables increasingly large  market shares in different locations. We are,  however, aiming to avoid establishing chains,  as the American-style world of chains does not  suit us. In Finland, the market for this is too  small. Expansion requires many new individual  concepts, which are tailored to suit the needs of  each locality. By means of our operating model,  we can not only boost our operations locally, but  also offer a comprehensive range of restaurants  for our customers. Our diverse portfolio com- prises a chain of experiences, including café,  restaurant and entertainment services from early  morning till late night. In recent years, the overall market in the restau- rant field in Finland has grown by approximately  3−4%, or somewhat stronger than the gross  national product. In 2013, increase in turnover in  the sector was 1.4%. Although the general eco- nomic situation in Finland has continued to be  unstable and costs have continued to climb, their  effects on the company’s products and their  demand have been relatively small. Despite the  general economic situation, Restamax has been  able to maintain excellent profitability, clearly  above the average profitability of the field.  Our operating environment is also strongly af- fected by the ongoing debate in Parliament on  alcohol legislation. The restaurant sector is a  significant employer in Finland. The decision  made by the government not to raise value added  tax is a sign of recognition of the significance of  the sector, and gives new hope for the recovery  of the restaurant business.

EBITDA was MEUR 1.4 (MEUR 1.3). The Group’s  operating profit was TEUR 87 (TEUR -23).  The EBITDA includes a non-recurring expense of  approximately MEUR 0.3 of the business transac- tions made during Q1 2014. As expected, the income of the beginning of the  year was slightly better than that of last year. The  slight growth in turnover is explained by the   investments made to Gastromax and Rengasravin- tolat in the beginning of 2014. EBITDA also increased slightly from the same  period last year. The Gastromax purchase was made  in the beginning of 2014, but the company only  started its operations towards the end of the Q1  review period. The Rengasravintolat acquisition was  made in early March. Thus the business transac- tions in question did not have a significant impact  on the review period EBITDA. Due to the seasonal nature of the restaurant business,  most of the profits are made at the end of the year. The group’s net cash flow between January and  March was MEUR 1.1 (MEUR -2.1).  During the review period, Restamax has made  significant corporate acquisitions and growth  investments, including the purchase of Gastro- max Oy and the acquisition of the Rengasravin- tolat Group. Several restaurant renovations and  concept renewals have also taken place during  the review period.  The group’s interest-bearing net liabilities at the  end of March were MEUR 7.7 (MEUR 8.7). The  group’s net financial expenses between Janu- ary and March were TEUR 13.6 (TEUR 168.5). The  equity ratio was 61.3% (40.4%) and gearing ratio  20.3% (65.6%). New brewery contract Restamax has entered into a new brewery con- tract that came into effect on 1 January 2014. With  the current purchase volumes, the annual income  effect of the new contract before income tax is  approximately 800,000 euros. Gastromax Oy Restamax and Hans Välimäki Oy, owned by Hans  Välimäki, founded in January 2014 the Gastromax  Oy joint venture, of which Restamax owns 70%  and Hans Välimäki Oy 30%. The joint venture  has purchased the Midhill restaurants located in  Helsinki and Tampere, previously partially owned  by Hans Välimäki through various companies, as  well as the operations of two other restaurants. Food Park In January 2014, Restamax opened a new Food  Park restaurant mix in Ideapark in Lempäälä. This  is one of the largest restaurant mixes inside a  shopping centre in the entire Nordic region. Purchase of the Rengasravintolat Group In March 2014, Restamax purchased all shares in  Rengasravintolat Oy. The business transaction  covers Rengasravintolat Oy and 16 restaurants  that are owned by its full subsidiaries in Helsinki,  Tampere, Jyväskylä, and Pori. Work & Leisure Club Union In March 2014, a nightclub for young adults called  Union Work & Leisure Club was opened in Kirk- kokatu, Tampere. Masu Asian Bistro In March 2014, the company renewed the concept  of the Flame restaurant located in Hämeenkatu,  Tampere.

INTERIM REPORT Q1/2016 Q1/2016  JANUARY–MARCH 2016 IN BRIEF Figures in parentheses refer to the same period last  year, unless otherwise stated. Entire Group: The Group’s turnover was MEUR 27.2 (MEUR 24.5),  growth of 11.3 per cent. EBITDA was MEUR 2.8 (MEUR  2.9), decrease of 4.0 per cent. Operating profit was  MEUR 0.2 (MEUR 0.8), decrease of 74.1 per cent. Restaurant business: The turnover of the restaurant business segment  was MEUR 23.1 (MEUR 22.4), growth of 3.0 per cent.  EBITDA was MEUR 2.3 (MEUR 2.6), decrease of 9.6  per cent. Operating profit was MEUR 0.0 (MEUR 0.7),  decrease of 96.6 per cent. Labour hire business: The turnover of the labour hire business was MEUR  6.5 (MEUR 4.3), growth of 51.2 per cent. EBITDA was  MEUR 0.6 (MEUR 0.4), growth of 30.7 per cent.  Operating profit was MEUR 0.2 (MEUR 0.1), growth  of 35.7 per cent. Profit guidance (as of 23 February 2016): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  and profitability to remain on a good level in the 2016  financial year. RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT  1 JANUARY–31 MARCH 2016 TURNOVER INCREASED MORE THAN 11 PER CENT IN JANUARY–MARCH 2016 Q1/2016  CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues on next page The first quarter of 2016 was challenging Between January and March 2016, the turnover of  the entire Group increased more than 11 per cent,  EBITDA dropped by 4 per cent and operating profit  declined by 74 per cent from the previous year. Last  year’s reference period, i.e. the first quarter of 2015,  was good. The unusually cold weather in January affected the  sales of our restaurants in January. Our seasonal  restaurants in the north of the country achieved a  reasonably good result. Easter is a challenging period  for the restaurant business, and this year it was  within the first quarter. In part, this showed as an  increase in the personnel costs and as a decrease in  the turnover of our business operations. Moreover,  our operational management was not prepared to  react swiftly enough to the change in the demand of  our services that took place at the beginning of the  year. This was a good reminder of how susceptible  the field is to shifts in economic trends and how  situations on the restaurant markets can change  very rapidly. Our result was also affected by the  opening of new restaurants and the discontinuation  of a number of old ones. In both the restaurant and labour hire sector, the  result is primarily made towards the end of the year,  and the first quarter is always the weakest. During the review period, we opened a Passion Food  & Bar restaurant and Pizzeria Bella Roma in Jyväskylä,  a Classic American Diner restaurant at the Jumbo  Shopping Centre in Vantaa, and we purchased the  business operations of the Namu and Showroom  restaurants located in Helsinki. Expanding our  operations to Southern Finland also supports our  growth strategy. It is our goal to continue to improve  our position in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The  openings and investments carried out in the first  quarter, along with the acquisition last year of a  majority shareholding in Hernesaaren Ranta Oy,  strongly support this objective. Recovery and thousands of new jobs in the field The economy is estimated to see some gradual  growth in early 2016. Consumer expectations for the  spring are low, which implies that the travel and  restaurant sector will have a slow period at the  beginning of the year. Consumer expectations  collapsed by last summer, and overall confidence in  the economy is currently clearly below the long-term  average. However, there are signs of recovery over  the long term. For example, according to forecasts  prepared by ETLA, the Research Institute of the  Finnish Economy, Finland’s GDP will grow by slightly  less than one per cent in 2016. This growth is expected  to increase in 2017 and 2018. The Finnish Hospitality Association MaRa’s forecasts  indicate that turnover in the restaurant field increased  by about 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2016.  Restaurant food sales are increasing but the sale of  alcohol continues to decline. Up to 64 per cent of  the turnover of the restaurant field comes from food  sales. According to monitoring by MaRa, the turnover  of fast food restaurants in Finland increased by as  much as 7.1 per cent. Thousands of new jobs are expected to emerge in the  travel and restaurant sector by 2020. New restaurants  are being opened particularly in growth centres and  new shopping centres. Fast food restaurants in the  Helsinki Metropolitan Area are expected to create up  to 2,000 new jobs over the course of 2015 and 2016.  The growth prospects are strong especially in growth  centres, where the demand for restaurants and other  companies providing experiences is high. These  prospects are effectively supported by Restamax’s  investment in the SuperPark indoor activity parks at  the turn of the year, the opening of the Classic  American Diner at the Jumbo Shopping Centre in  Vantaa in February, and the opening of the Lintsi  American Diner at the Linnanmäki amusement park  in April. New goals guiding operations We began 2016 by focusing our efforts on the new  long-term goals set by our Board of Directors. Our goal  is to expand our restaurant operations abroad. At the  same time, we will also continue our profitable growth  in Finland in the restaurant and labour hire businesses.  Our turnover target for 2018 is to reach MEUR 180 by  the end of that year. EBITDA and operating profit are  expected to remain on a good level. Q1/2016  The expansion abroad gives us the opportunity to  export our existing brands to new market areas.  We can establish ourselves in other countries with  our numerous restaurant concepts that are already  exportable. We see immense potential in concepts  like Stefan’s Steakhouse, diners located in shopping  centres and growth centres, and entertainment and  game centres. These will allow us to succeed outside  the Finnish borders.  There are some 10,000 restaurants in Finland, of  which we own over 100. Therefore, we have not  yet met the limits of domestic growth and still see  significant potential on the Finnish market. We will  continue our active efforts to survey the markets  both in Finland and abroad. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut strengthened  and expanded its operations In January, Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut, our subsidiary  that engages in the labour hire business, strength- ened its position in Turku by acquiring the operations  of TOR-Palvelut Oy, a labour hire company that spe- cialises in the restaurant sector. At the same time,  Smile signed a long-term cooperation agreement  with Turun Oopperaravintolat Oy and Juhla-Ansa Oy,  which are owned by Oldfellows Oy, on the provision  of labour hire services. In the review period in the labour hire segment, our  turnover increased by over 50 per cent compared to  the previous year, EBITDA increased by over 30 per  cent, and operating profit increased by over 35 per  cent. This is testament to the fact that labour hire  operations have quickly grown into a significant part  of our Group, and we now have a basis for comparing  the development.  At the beginning of 2016, Smile also expanded its  operations to a new field, retail trade. Smile Retail Oy  supplies labour to various trade outlets from grocery  shops to specialised shops. Factors such as the new  longer opening hours ensure considerable growth  potential in the sector. Expanding our operations  to retail trade also makes it possible for us to offer  restaurant workers more diverse employment and  earning opportunities. The total worth of the labour hire business in Finland  is about EUR 1.5 billion, and the total turnover of the  field was over a billion euros in 2015, with nearly 14  per cent growth from the preceding year. The turn- over of the staffing services sector is expected to  increase by 6.6 per cent over the first half of 2016.  About two-thirds of the total turnover of the staffing  services sector comes from labour hire. The pros- pects for the field remain rather positive. An increas- ing proportion of recruitment is made through labour  hire arrangements. Bright future despite the economic downturn As said, the Finnish economy is expected to grow  only slightly in 2016. In 2016, private consumption is  estimated to increase slower than in 2015 as unem- ployment will remain high and the development of  earnings is slow. The growth challenges in the field are primarily  caused by a lack in purchasing power, which the  planned social contract would likely initially weaken.  The contract is expected to specifically weaken the  domestic market, as the positive effects will focus on  exports. What would be needed alongside the pos- sible social contract are tax reductions to increase  purchasing power. This would ensure that customers  could consume more and turn the domestic market  to a much-awaited climb towards recovery. A reduc- tion of income taxes would also have a positive effect  on domestic demand and employment.  Politics and the overall reform of alcohol legislation  will have a major impact on the restaurant sector in  particular. If the new act enters into force in 2017, we  can expect significant reductions in the regulation of  alcohol sales. Although the general economic situation has been  challenging in Finland in recent years, Restamax has  been able to increase its turnover more efficiently  than the general developments would give reason  to expect. At the same time, we have been able to  maintain good profitability, which is clearly above  the average profitability within the industry. We believe that our profitable business and growth  will continue despite the prevailing market situation.

The Company’s goal is to reach a turnover of MEUR  180 by the end of 2018. RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT  1 JANUARY–31 MARCH 2017 TURNOVER INCREASED BY 17.5 PER CENT AND   OPERATING PROFIT BY MORE THAN 266 PER CENT IN JANUARY–MARCH 2017 Q1/2017 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues on next page The first quarter of 2017 was successful Between January and March 2017, the turnover of the  entire Group increased by 17.5 per cent, EBITDA by  almost 18 per cent and operating profit by over 266  per cent from last year. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a rather good  result compared to the previous year. Our EBITDA  is strong – our profitability is among the best in the  restaurant industry as measured by EBITDA. Our  previously high depreciation level has relatively  stabilised, which is beginning to show in our operating  profit level. In the restaurant business segment, the  operating profit increased by more than 1,550 per  cent from the previous year, and in the labour hire  business segment, by more than 110 per cent. We increased our market share according to plan late  last year, especially in Northern Finland. The inte- gration of the new Northern units, i.e. three Colorado  Bar & Grill restaurants and the Kuura, Pizza Block and  Mura Sushi restaurants, into our operations has been  successful, which had a positive impact on our result  in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of the year, we also strengthened  our positions in Pirkanmaa, our main market area.  In January 2017, together with Koskiravintolat Oy,  a veteran company in the restaurant business, we  established a new limited company, Rivermax Oy. As  a result of this, our restaurant portfolio now includes  the Tampere restaurants Poro (former Hullu Poro),  Jackie Brown and Jackie Brown Gold, von Nottbeck  in Näsilinna, the summer restaurant Laituri and,  in Pori, the Kirjuri summer restaurant. Our collab- oration aims at providing new kinds of restaurant  experiences in both Pirkanmaa and Satakunta that  are even higher-quality and more memorable than  before. The popular Thai Papaya restaurants in the Helsinki  area became part of our portfolio at the turn of the  year, and we opened a new restaurant based on this  concept at Ideapark in Lempäälä in March. We also  renovated the Foodpark restaurant area at Ideapark  in Lempäälä, opened a BeefKing restaurant in Lielahti  in Tampere and expanded our operations into the  escape room game business by opening the Run Out  escape rooms in Tampere. In addition, we bought  the popular event restaurant Yo-talo in Tampere  and, together with Rivermax, the Tillikka restaurant  complex. In Helsinki, we increased our ownership of Herne- saaren Ranta, diversified the services of the area and  acquired the business of the Vespa restaurant, on  the premises of which we will open a new restau- rant during the spring. At the end of March, we also  opened the Skohan nightclub in the Helsinki city  centre in collaboration with rap artist Jare “Cheek”  Tiihonen and event producer Kalle Kallonen. In  Joensuu, the Gloria nightclub was taken over by our  subsidiary Northmax Oy. Our subsidiary Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy expand- ed its operations to a new field and now also sup- plies ICT and office professionals. Smile Industries,  which started its operations in late 2016 and supplies  labour for industry, construction and logistics, has  strengthened its market position in early 2017. The  growth of the labour hire business has been even  faster than the restaurant business, and labour hire  has become an increasingly important part of the  operations of the Group. Demand for restaurant services on the increase The increased tourism in Lapland increases the de- mand for restaurant services and creates new jobs in  the field. Thanks to clean nature, cultural experiences,  internationally awarded chefs and safety, Finland has  become an attractive travel destination worldwide.  Especially the number of Chinese, Russian, Swedish,  German and British tourists has increased in the last  few years.  The economic situation in the tourism and restaurant  industry has improved significantly after many weak  years, although it is still below average. The compa- Q1/2017 nies in the field expect growth to be slightly faster  in the spring and profitability to remain the same.  According to the turnover forecast by the Finnish  Hospitality Association (MaRa), in the first quarter  of 2017 the turnover of restaurants increased by 6.5  per cent and the turnover of the whole tourism and  restaurant sector by 6.9 per cent. In the correspond- ing period last year, the growth of turnover in the  field was approximately four per cent. The biggest reasons for the poor profitability of the  restaurant sector are high taxes and high add-on  costs of salaries. Our concept-based business model  and our subsidiary Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut enable  effective and quick reactions to customer demand,  market changes and changing needs of different  seasons. During the review period, the collective agreements  of employees and managers concerning tourism,  restaurant and leisure services were revised for   1 February 2017–31 January 2018 in accordance with  the Competitiveness Pact made by central organisa- tions. The concrete effects of the Competitiveness  Pact on the operations of our company can probably  not be observed until after the present year. Growth of labour hire accelerating Labour hire is a field of future growth full of poten- tial – it combines the flexible needs of employees  and employers in constantly changing working life.  In addition, the demand in the sector has been found  to have increased, amongst other things, because of  globalisation and technical development. Up to 80 per cent of the turnover of staffing services  is made up of labour hire services. The turnover of  labour hire services for January 2017 was MEUR 69.9  in Finland, an increase of 23 per cent over the previ- ous year. The development of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut re- flects the positive prospects and growth estimates  of the sector, although the growth has been sub- stantially stronger than the average development  of the sector. After the review period, Smile Hen- kilöstöpalvelut bought the entire shareholding of  Pasianssi Oy (Banssi Henkilöstöpalvelut) in April and  took a big step towards the top of the sector: Banssi  operates in 14 cities and has some 2,000 employees  in its staff bank. In addition to organic growth, we  also intend to map new targets for corporate acqui- sitions this year. In the middle of growth, we want  profitability to remain on a good level. During the early part of the year, Smile Hen- kilöstöpalvelut renewed its brand to better corre- spond with the procedures and views of the com- pany. In accordance with the company’s present  slogan, Smile wants to bring joy and positivity to  Finnish working life. Growth story of the Group continues In January we announced that I will leave the post of  CEO in June 2017, at which point I will have headed  our company for 12 years. I greatly value the people  with whom I have had the pleasure of working during  these years. Together we made Restamax an incred- ible growth story. For this I want to thank the whole  personnel, our partners and our customers.  I believe that in the coming years, the Group will  continue its growth that is stronger than the general  market development. This is signalled, for example,  by the fact that after the publication of the 2016 fi- nancial statements, our share price has increased at a  record rate. The highest share price was reached after  the review period, on 6 April 2017, when the price for  our share rose to EUR 7.54. The first quarter of the year is always the weakest  period in our business, because in both business seg- ments, the generation of profit is focused on the end  of the year. The first quarter of 2017 is a strong indi- cation that this year will once again be successful.

PROSPECTS FOR 2018 Results management (as of 20 February 2018): In accordance with its strategy, Restamax expects  the Group’s turnover to increase and profitability to  remain on a good level in both segments in the 2018  financial period. The restaurant segment is expected  to reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 140 and  in labour hire, a turnover of approximately MEUR 110  is expected, the total turnover being some MEUR 240  after eliminations. Restamax’s goal is to reach a turnover of approxi- mately MEUR 400 by the end of 2020 after internal  eliminations. The goal of the restaurant segment is to  reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 200, and the  goal of the labour hire segment is to reach a turnover  of approximately MEUR 220 by the end of 2020. Q1/2018 Continues on next page Preparing for future growth In January–March 2018, our Group’s turnover grew by  almost 55 per cent, EBITDA by more than 31 per cent  and operating profit by 22 per cent compared to the  corresponding period the previous year. Early in the year, we made some significant organisa- tional changes in order to reach our strategic growth  targets. Our goal is to reach a turnover of approxi- mately MEUR 400 by the end of 2020, of which the  restaurant segment accounts for approximately MEUR  200, excluding the acquisition of the share capital of  Royal Ravintolat Oy, and the labour hire segment   approximately MEUR 220. In January 2018, we updated our administration, and  in future we will focus more strongly on managing  our new business units, intensifying our acquisitions  and ensuring our customer and employee satisfaction.  Furthermore, we will invest more heavily in sales and  marketing.  As concerns the restaurant business, the turnover of  the first quarter grew as expected. The changes to our  new organisational and operating model impacted  the result of the first quarter and the positive effects  started to show in March. In the labour hire business,  we achieved a clearly better result during the first  quarter than last year. Even though early 2018 was a time of changes and  investments, we were able to keep our key efficiency  figures, including staff expenses and material margin,  at a good level. Our depreciation level has relatively  stabilised, which has started to reflect also on our  operating profit level. New concepts to respond to the growing demand of  the restaurant business During the review period, we boosted our position in  our familiar market areas by opening both popular and  brand new concepts. We opened a new Mango Disco- Bar nightclub in Oulu and responded to the increased  demand of different experiences by opening two new  Run Out escape rooms in Seinäjoki and the Vihahuone  rage room and pitch black Dark Room escape room in  Tampere. To the best of our knowledge, these two are  the first of their kind in Finland. In March 2018, the reform of the Alcohol Act entered  fully into force and boosted the industry. The change  in the legislation allows, among other things, happy  hour marketing, longer opening hours and take-away  retail sales of alcohol at restaurants. Several of our  restaurants have made use of the amendments, and  we believe that they will continue to have a positive  impact on the average size of customer purchases and  on the flow of customers. Generally speaking, according to the economic barom- eter by Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), the  expectations regarding the economic trends of the  restaurant industry are positive, yet cautious. The  estimated turnover of restaurants promises a growth  of 4.4 per cent for the second quarter of the year.  Consumer confidence in the economy is also at a good  level. In February–March 2018, the readings of the  confidence indicator were the highest measured during  the 30 years of its history. Becoming the leading restaurant operator in the  Nordic countries In March, we took our first step towards internation- alisation. We expanded our restaurant business to  Denmark by purchasing over 90 per cent of the popu- lar Danish Cock’s & Cows and The Bird restaurants.  Cock’s & Cows, with its award-winning premium  burgers, and The Bird, famous for its gin and tonic,  have established their positions in the restaurant  industry of their homeland. The brands have a total of  11 restaurants in prime locations in Copenhagen and,  during the summer, they will open new units at the  Copenhagen international airport. The highly interesting and fragmented markets both  in Denmark and elsewhere in Northern Europe create  potential for Restamax’s strong growth in various   CEO JUHA HELMINEN Q1/2018 Continues from previous page segments of the restaurant business. Our aim is to  grow aggressively on the international restaurant  market in the next 3 to 5 years. Our internationalisation is also supported by the ac- quisition of Royal Ravintolat Oy, which we announced  in April 2018. Upon its realisation, the transaction will  be the largest corporate transaction in the history of  the restaurant industry in Finland. Royal Ravintolat  has more than 70 restaurants all over Finland, and the  company employs approximately one thousand people.  Together, we will form one of the largest restaurant  groups in the Nordic countries, and our goal is to  become the leading restaurant operator in Northern  Europe by 2020. Royal Ravintolat is particularly well-known for its  long-term and highly esteemed concepts in the Hel- sinki metropolitan area, whereas Restamax’s casual  restaurants have a strong market position elsewhere  in Finland. Royal Ravintolat’s brands include Savoy,  Löyly, Elite, Palace and Teatteri and the scalable con- cepts of the Hanko Sushi, Pizzarium and Sandro. Upon  the realisation of the share transaction, I will take  charge of our company’s foreign operations, and Royal  Ravintolat CEO Aku Vikström will assume responsibil- ity for the company’s operations in Finland. The deal  is expected to be realised during summer 2018. The listing of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut evaluated The result of the labour hire business for the review  period was rather good. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut’s  growth continues to be stronger than the general  growth of the industry, and the company is now  among the largest labour hire companies operating   in Finland. The company is actively seeking solutions  for the labour shortage in Finland. Its strong growth was facilitated, in addition to organic  growth, by two major transactions: In February 2018,  Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut purchased Kymppi Service  Oy, operating in the sectors of industry, construction  and logistics; and in March 2018, the majority of the  national construction-sector labour hire company  Adicio Oy, specialising in foreign manpower. With  these transactions, the company gained a stronger  foothold in the busy economic areas of Southwest  Finland and Satakunta and became a part of the new  national service concept solving the labour needs of  Finnish companies by importing foreign manpower. In March 2018, we announced that our Board of Direc- tors is evaluating the listing of Smile Henkilöstö- palvelut on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The evalua- tion process will be carried out during spring 2018. The  potential listing would enable Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut  to strengthen its own balance sheet and to grow even  more quickly to the top of labour hire companies. Share price at a record high We enjoy strong confidence among investors and in  the market. At the end of March 2017, the value of  Restamax’s share was EUR 6.70, whereas at the end  of March this year it was EUR 8.70. The measures em- ployed at the beginning of the year were also reflected  in our target price, which equity research company In- deres increased to EUR 12.0 in mid-April. The invest- ments made will help us achieve our target turnover. We have positive expectations for the remainder of  the year, a time when the majority of our result is  traditionally made. We expect the Group’s turnover to  increase and profitability to remain on a good level in  both segments in the 2018 financial period.
