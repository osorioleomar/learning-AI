MOVING TOWARDS THE FUTURE
Jón Sigurðsson
Össur President and CEO
We are dedicated to improving people’s 
mobility with our products and services. We 
will continue to focus on sustainable growth, 
successful innovations for our customers and 
increased efficiency. However, in everything we 
do, we do not forget the reason why Össur’s 
employees come to work every day—to help our 
customers live a Life Without Limitations.
Sustainable Growth
In 2013 we strengthened our sales channels 
and operations through several strategic 
acquisitions in Brazil, Norway and Sweden. This 
is an important strategic step for us and we are 
excited to continue building a strong Company 
for the future. The sales growth in 2013 was 9% 
and sales totaled USD 436 million. The sales 
growth in EMEA continues in all market and 
key products. We are also experiencing gradual 
improvements in market conditions in the 
Americas.
Successful Innovation
We had significant product launches in 2013, 
including the Unity® Advanced Vacuum 
Suspension System, which was very well 
received. We also launched an updated version 
of our flagship ligament brace, CTi®. We 
continue to focus on our premium designs, 
always pushing for greater innovation and 
better outcomes. Moving forward, we will be 
dividing our bracing and supports range and 
creating a dual emphasis on OA Solutions and 
Injury Solutions. OA Solutions help people 
living with osteoarthritis achieve a more active 
lifestyle while Injury Solutions improve mobility 
and encourage healing. The identification of 
these two major segments within our bracing 
and supports product range will further support 
our customers’ needs for indication-based 
innovation.
Increased Efficiency 
We have identified operational excellence and 
process improvement as key avenues toward 
increased efficiency. In the second quarter of 
2013, we streamlined operations resulting in a 
leaner cost structure, and a reduction in costs 
of USD 5 million in 2013 and USD 8 million 
on annual basis. Toward the end of the year, 
we saw that our initiatives were successfully 
increasing efficiency and strengthening the core 
of our business. The EBITDA grew 8% and was 
USD 75 million at the end of the year.
Life Without Limitations
The Boston Marathon bombings shocked 
us all. In the aftermath of the horrific events, 
we at Össur wondered what we could do to 
help the victims put their lives back on track. 
That’s when we partnered with Challenged 
Athletes Foundation, a world leader in helping 
individuals with physical challenges get and stay 
involved with sports. Together, we co-hosted 
a running and mobility clinic at Harvard 
University in October, inviting survivors of the 
bombings to participate.

Jón Sigurðsson
Össur President and CEO
In addition to partnering with the Challenged 
Athletes Foundation, our Team Össur members 
reached their ambitious goals. Our sponsored 
athletes once again dominated the winners’ 
podium at the IPC World Championships in July. 
In September, we supported double amputee 
Richard Whitehead as he ran the length of the 
UK, the equivalent of 40 marathons in 40 days. 
We were also very excited to be named an 
official provider to “Walking with the Wounded” 
on their 2013 expedition to the South Pole.
These achievements remind us how proud 
we are to be in this business. We are truly 
fortunate to work in an industry where we can 
increase people’s mobility with our products 
and solutions, and therefore change millions 
of lives around the world. Our success is 
driven by a passion and commitment to make 
Life Without Limitations a reality.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016      5
Jon Sigurdsson
Össur President and CEO
CEO’s Address
As a pioneer of innovation and technological advancements, Össur is a global leader in 
non-invasive orthopaedics. We are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of existing
technology in order to break the barriers on progress so we can help more people live a 
life without limitations.
Expanding our product offering
This last year has provided us with opportunities to diversify our product portfolio and to increase our impact as an industry leader. 
The prosthetics side of our business made huge strides with the acquisition of Medi Prosthetics and Touch Bionics. Medi Prosthetics 
brings a full line of products to help us complete our offerings for lower extremity prosthetics. The addition of Touch Bionics will allow 
us to add cutting edge upper extremity prosthetics to our product offerings. Incorporating these two allies into Össur will allow us to 
reach a wider range of patients and help more individuals live lives without limitations.
Impressive outcomes
In 2016, our bracing and supports products paved the way for future breakthroughs with our participation in a revolutionary stem 
cell treatment for joint pain in Australia. With Össur braces being used as part of the treatment regimen, the dramatic results showed 
that half of the patients had a 75% improvement in pain. These impressive outcomes show great promise for the future prognosis of 
joint ailments. Additionally, our innovative Rebound® PCL brace won the Sports Medicine Award in the rehabilitation category from 
Orthopedics This Week.
Strong operational results
We continue to focus investments on growth opportunities, as well as returning value to shareholders through dividends and share 
buybacks. We are happy to close another year with strong operational results. We saw good sales growth in both EMEA and Americas 
resulting in 9% growth and sales of USD 521 million. We have been focused on optimizing our business processes and strengthening 
our competitive advantage through operational excellence.
Our customers continue to inspire us
Exceeding all expectations, our athletic community raised the bar in various events across the world. Team Össur truly shined at the 
Rio Paralympics this year in Brazil, winning 26 medals. We also had the opportunity to participate in the first ever Cyblathon event 
that showcased how those with disabilities work through their daily challenges with the help of modern technology. The outstanding 
courage and dedication exhibited by these athletes is an inspiration to us all.
Increasing mobility
Our strategy is built on three pillars; innovation, growth, and efficiency. We are committed to making people’s lives better by improving 
their mobility with our products and services, and we are committed to creating value and delivering long-term profitable growth for 
our stakeholders. By focusing on increasing the mobility of our end-users, staying true to our values, and striving for innovation, we 
are ensuring our success as an industry leader. At Össur, we are proud of our accomplishments. We have dedicated employees, we are 
grateful to our customers for their business and trust, and we are thankful for the support of our shareholders.

2017 in brief
As a global market leader in non-invasive orthopaedics, Össur maintained 
its market position as the second largest player in both prosthetics and 
bracing & supports in the year 2017.
Organic growth
5%
Net profit growth
13%
EBITDA margin
18%
NIBD/EBITDA 
1.2x
Growth in the year was driven by the prosthetics 
segment, which grew above estimated market 
growth, and high-end innovative products from both 
business segments. Local currency growth was 8% 
with the acquisitions made in the year 2016.
Net profit amounted to USD 58 million in the year or 
10% of sales. Diluted earnings per share amounted 
to 13.3 US cents. Good growth in profit can primarily 
be attributed to strong performance in sales.
EBITDA before special items grew by 10% in 
local currency and the margin was within the 
communicated financial guidance range. We 
accelerated our investments in R&D projects 
for high-end innovative products, such as bionic 
bracing, during the year. Even so, we grew our 
operating profit faster than sales with positive 
contribution from product mix, integration efforts 
and economies of scale.
Össur aims to maintain a healthy balance sheet with 
a level of net interest-bearing debt ratio of 1–2x 
to EBITDA. Össur has strong cash generation and 
as means to maintain the desired debt level, the 
Company acquired own shares for approximately 
USD 37 million during the year and paid out 
dividends in the amount of USD 7 million.

Sales by segments
Bracing and supports
Bracing and supports (B&S) sales amounted to USD 285 million and grew by 1% organically.
Growth in EMEA was good where the primary growth drivers were our high-end products, which include the Unloader One®. In 
the Americas, the Canadian market grew well and direct B&S sales in the US grew modestly. Growth in the Americas was however 
negatively impacted due to sales decline in own distribution companies. The nature of the operational challenges in our own 
distribution companies is mainly due to internal restructuring efforts. These distribution companies accounted for ~8% of our global 
B&S sales in 2017 and have had a negative impact on organic growth rates of about 1% on average in 2015-2017. This means that 
direct sales have been growing annually in line with the estimated 3-5% market growth during that period. The restructuring efforts are 
now mostly complete and we are expecting the distribution companies to have limited impact on growth in 2018. Growth in APAC was 
excellent with a good contribution from Australia, Japan, and China.
Over 10 new B&S products were introduced to the market in 2017. These include the Unloader One® Lite knee brace, which is a new 
addition to the growing OA solutions portfolio.
Prosthetics
Prosthetics sales amounted to USD 282 million and grew by 17% and 9% organically, both measured in local currency.
We continued to see good performance in prosthetics with growth above estimated market growth. Growth in EMEA was strong across 
all major regions with the RHEO KNEE® driving growth along with other high-end products. In a similar fashion, the RHEO KNEE® was 
the key organic growth driver in the Americas for prosthetics. There was excellent sales growth for prosthetics in APAC and are pleased 
to see our high-end products performing well in all regions. Performance in China was especially strong after adjusting the sales 
approach during 2016 and selling direct.
Sales of bionic products accounted for 21% of prosthetics component sales, compared to 24% in 2016. The decrease between years 
is attributed to additional mechanical products coming from the Medi Prosthetics acquisition and good performance in our high-end 
mechanical prosthetics solutions during the year.
Over 30 new prosthetic products were introduced to the market in 2017. These included new versions of the highly regarded RHEO 
KNEE® and powered thumb rotation as well as four new grips to accompany the i-Limb® Ultra hand.

for vores forretningsområder. Høreapparatforretningerne 
baserer sig på opdaterede teknologiske platforme og fl ere 
nye produktintroduktioner tidligt på året. Diagnostiske 
Instrumenter, der i 2008 har oplevet en meget høj vækst, 
er nu verdens største på sit felt og fremstår samtidig som 
en overordentlig lønsom forretning. Succesen skyldes ikke 
mindst, at der løbende anvendes betydelige ressourcer på 
produktudvikling, hvilket er med til at styrke Diagnostiske 
Instrumenters markedsposition. Personlig Kommunikation 
er det forretningsområde, der er mest påvirket af konjunk-
turerne, og vi må i 2009 forvente et vist pres på både Phonic 
Ear og Sennheiser Communications. Men begge forretninger 
er meget stærke på hver sit felt, hvilket sætter dem i stand til 
fortsat at vinde markedsandele.
Samlet set befi nder koncernen sig i en gunstig situation på 
trods af fi nanskrisen og afmatningen i verdensøkonomien, 
idet et betydeligt positivt cashfl ow giver os frihed til at agere 
i markedet, når mulighederne opstår. Vi vælger derfor at fast-
holde vores dedikerede satsning på produktudvikling, da dette 
vil komme os til gode på den lidt længere bane og utvivlsomt 
vil betyde, at vi kommer styrket ud på den anden side, når 
markedsvæksten vender tilbage. 
Vi har også valgt at afsætte ressourcer til udvikling af helt 
nye forretningsområder, eksempelvis Oticon Medical, hvis 
produktområde er såkaldte benforankrede høreløsninger. 
På verdensplan ligger her et lovende marked med et betyde-
ligt uudnyttet vækstpotentiale — et marked, som tilmed kun 
ganske få producenter har den tekniske kompetence til at 
operere på. Oticon Medical forventes at sende sine første 
kommercielle produkter på markedet i andet halvår af 2009. 
Som beskrevet indledningsvis har 2008 været et år med ud-
fordringer, som utvivlsomt vil fortsætte ind i 2009. William 
Demant Holding-koncernen er begunstiget af en meget stærk 
virksomheds- og medarbejderkultur, og det har været en 
fornøjelse at opleve, hvordan alle medarbejdere har været 
villige til at gøre en ekstra indsats i et udfordrende år. Jeg vil 
derfor gerne benytte lejligheden til at sige en varm personlig 
tak for den store indsats, som alle medarbejdere i koncernen 
har ydet. 
  Niels Jacobsen
  Adm. direktør
Kære læser
2008 var et udfordrende år for hele høreapparatindustrien. 
For første gang i mange år var vi på fl ere markeder vidne til et 
egentligt fald i styksalget af høreapparater. Især i andet halvår 
måtte vi konstatere, at fi nanskrisen har påvirket mange brugere 
til at udskyde deres køb af høreapparater. Dertil kommer, at vi 
i et vigende marked har oplevet en stigende priskonkurrence, 
idet fl ere producenter i højere grad valgte at bruge prisen som 
konkurrenceparameter for i nogen grad at kompensere for det 
vigende styksalg.
Ud over de vanskelige markedsforhold bød 2008 også på 
store udfordringer for William Demant Holding-koncernen. 
De seneste års salgssucces Oticon Delta kom under pres 
allerede fra starten af 2008. Samtidig betød det trådløse 
paradigmeskifte, som blev introduceret med Oticon Epoq 
i 2007, at en betydelig del af vores udviklingsressourcer i 
slutningen af 2007 og i begyndelsen af 2008 blev anvendt 
på at sikre det trådløse systems tekniske stabilitet. Vi er nu 
ovre skiftet til en helt ny teknologisk platform, der i dag 
fremstår meget stabil og samtidig leverer betydelige bruger-
fordele, som brugerne af vores nyeste høreapparater – Oticon 
Epoq, Oticon Dual og Oticon Vigo – dagligt nyder godt af.
Med introduktionerne af Oticon Dual og Bernafons Move og 
Avanti står koncernen stærkt rustet til konkurrencen i 2009, 
og allerede i dette forår vil en palet af nye produkter styrke 
produktprogrammet yderligere. Det er derfor med optimisme, 
at vi går ind i 2009.
Det er min klare opfattelse, at markedssituationen i 2009 
fortsat vil være vanskelig, men den stigende ældrebefolkning 
sikrer, at behovet for vores ydelser også vil være der fremover. 
Og historisk set har tidligere tiders tilbagegang på enkeltmar-
keder været efterfulgt af særligt gode perioder, idet de mange, 
der for en tid udskød deres køb af høreapparater, vil komme 
tilbage sammen med de mange nye ældre, der er kommet til 
siden da. Vi forventer derfor, at den nuværende periode med 
lavvækst vil blive afl øst af en periode med stor vækst, ligesom 
vi tror på, at andet halvår 2009 vil blive bedre end andet halvår 
2008. I den aktuelle situation er disse forudsigelser naturligvis 
behæftet med usikkerhed. 
Selvom 2009 markedsmæssigt ser udfordrende ud, går vi 
ikke desto mindre ind i året med en god portion optimisme 
Gode resultater i et vanskeligt år

2008 i overskrifter
Et udfordrende år
Det er ikke nogen hemmelighed, at 2008 på mange måder 
har været et usædvanligt og udfordrende år for hele høreap-
paratindustrien, idet den generelle økonomiske usikkerhed 
påvirkede høreapparatsalget negativt. Industrien oplevede 
en sjældent set volumennedgang på flere større markeder 
samtidig, hvilket var særligt udtalt i andet halvår, og den 
manglende markedsvækst påvirkede naturligvis også kon-
cernens to høreapparatforretninger. Dertil kommer, at de 
seneste par års salgssucces Oticon Delta allerede fra starten 
af 2008 blev mødt af øget konkurrence. Set i dette lys har 
koncernen i 2008 klaret sig udmærket, om end en realiseret 
omsætning på DKK 5.374 mio. og en organisk vækst på 1 % 
tydeligvis ligger under de lagte planer for perioden. Samlet 
set er koncernens omsætning faldet 2 % i forhold til 2007, 
men en negativ valutakurspåvirkning på 4 % betyder, at 
koncernen har opnået en fremgang i omsætningen på 2 % 
opgjort i lokal valuta. Årets resultat af primær drift (EBIT) er 
realiseret med DKK 1.042 mio. svarende til en overskudsgrad 
på 19,4 %. Resultatet er dog negativt påvirket af valutakurs-
udviklingen, herunder i særlig grad af kursbevægelserne i 
britiske pund og amerikanske dollar. 
Igen industriens stærkeste produktportefølje
Koncernens betydelige satsning på den trådløse RISE-
arkitektur og introduktionen heraf tilbage i 2007 har i høj 
grad medvirket til at sikre koncernens teknologiske fører-
position i industrien, men medførte samtidig et betydeligt 
ressourcetræk i udviklingsorganisationen. Koncernen var 
derfor i 2007 og i begyndelsen af 2008 ikke i stand til at 
lancere nye produktkoncepter i samme tempo og omfang 
som tidligere, og dette har været en medvirkende årsag til, 
at koncernen i 2008 ikke formåede at tage helt de samme 
markedsandele som i de foregående år. 
Som året er skredet frem, har koncernen dog udvidet især 
Oticons produktportefølje. Med lanceringen af Oticon Vigo i 
foråret blev koncernens position i midtprissegmentet styrket 
markant, og det succesfulde produktkoncept har givet den 
mere omkostningsbevidste slutbruger mulighed for at drage 
nytte af den hurtige RISE-arkitektur. Oktober måned bød på 
årets vel nok mest interessante lancering, idet Oticon Dual 
gjorde op med slutbrugerens dilemma omkring det at skulle 
vælge mellem markedets audiologisk bedste høreapparat og 
markedets mest attraktive design. Oticon Dual kombinerer 
nemlig det bedste fra Oticon Delta og Oticon Epoq, og det 
store antal produktvarianter gør, at produktkonceptet appel-
lerer til en meget bred målgruppe, hvad angår både priser 
og brugerfordele. Endelig præsenterede Oticon i efteråret 
de nye Power RITE-løsninger, der kan anvendes sammen 
med alle BTE-varianter af Epoq og Vigo. Med Power RITE-
løsningerne tilbydes brugere med kraftige høretab ikke blot 
en uovertruffen lydkvalitet i et attraktivt design, men også 
adgang til blandt andet trådløs Bluetooth-forbindelse til 
telefon og tv.
I mange henseender også et positivt år
Trods udfordringerne var 2008 i mange henseender også et 
positivt år. Ud over den markante udbygning og forbedring 
af især Oticons produktportefølje, der som nævnt gennem-
gik en betydelig transformation og fornyelse, kan følgende 
positive elementer fremhæves:

2 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2014 2014 IN BRIEF
2014 IN BRIEF
When we closed the books on 2014, we had completed a 
high-paced business integration and faced, probably, one of 
the most exciting years in Acando’s history. We grew at many 
of our important and large customers in Sweden through 
expansion of existing assignments and new, challenging 
projects, often because of our collective, broader offering 
and delivery capacity. In parallel, our clear positioning and 
size in the market creates new possibilities with, both major 
global customers and smaller rapidly growing companies.

 2014 IN BRIEF ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2014 3 
FIRST QUARTER JANUARY–MARCH
  The year started with a market recovery, particularly 
in the Nordic markets where projects were now being 
initiated and previously postponed investments  
reactivated.
  Acando signed several new agreements for the  
implementation of business support systems for 
various types of customers based on Microsoft  
Dynamics CRM and AX in both Sweden and Norway.
  A framework agreement was signed with a global 
industrial group for management consulting ser-
vices. The agreement initially runs for a period of 
three years with an option to extend.
  Acando entered into a partnership agreement  
regarding BizView system support to supplement 
the analytics offering. 
SECOND QUARTER APRIL–JUNE
  In a press release on June 9, 2014, Acando announced 
a recommended public takeover bid for the shares in 
Connecta AB (publ).
  The operations in Sweden and Germany improved in 
terms of results and the markets in these countries 
remained unchanged, though with some uncertainty 
with respect to major investments. 
  In Norway, final integration was completed of E-vita 
AS, which was acquired at the end of 2013, and  
restructuring costs negatively impacted earnings in 
Norway but are expected to generate cost savings 
moving forward.
  The market for Acando’s services is characterized  
by ever larger projects with rising requirements for 
both operational and technological insight thus 
raising requirements for us to drive changes jointly 
with our customers. 
  Acando will become Orkla Shared Services’ imple-
mentation partner in the roll-out of SAP at several 
of the Orkla Group’s divisions. The implementation 
will be conducted in close collaboration with Orkla’s 
internal SAP organization. 
  In Norway, Acando signed an agreement to deliver 
intranet for the auditing company BDO, which has 
more than 1,000 employees and a large office net-
work in Norway.
THIRD QUARTER JULY–SEPTEMBER
  After the end of the acceptance period on July 10, 
Acando decided to proceed with the Offer since it had 
received acceptances representing more than 90 per-
cent of the shares. Connecta was consolidated into 
the Acando Group from August 1, 2014.
  The quarter was one of the most exciting in Acando’s 
history with intensive efforts to integrate Connecta 
and Acando. The merger received a positive response 
from our shared customers and succeeded in creat-
ing new customer dialogs that resulted in winning 
projects that neither Connecta nor Acando could 
have won alone. 
  Work on updating Acando’s brand profile, which  
is expected to lead to clearer positioning vis-à-vis 
competitors and increased attractiveness for  
employees.
  Acando signed a framework agreement with Moelven 
Industrier regarding Microsoft Dynamics implementa-
tion and administration services for the Moelven 
group companies, the project will be implemented 
using local resources in Sweden and Norway.
FOURTH QUARTER OCTOBER–DECEMBER
  Integration of Connecta and Acando was completed 
and the new merged unit now has a clear position as 
the leading consulting company in the Nordic region 
with operations in Sweden, Norway and Finland as 
well as favorable expansion opportunities in Germany.
  Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable 
across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digi-
tal transformation and completely new application 
areas for technology in business processes. 
  During the quarter, Acando assisted a telecoms  
operator with defining a strategic position and an 
initial implementation for e-health.
  Several projects went live, including a large retail 
solution based on MS Dynamics AX and a global SAP 
solution for the paper industry and, at the same time, 
Acando was leading one of the largest e-commerce 
projects in Sweden.

2 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2015 2015 IN BRIEF
2015 IN BRIEF
In 2015, Acando continued its transition toward becoming 
northern Europe’s leading consulting company. In terms of  
financial performance, for the first time, the Group’s sales  
surpassed SEK 2 billion and, an operating profit of SEK 168 m

to creating greater value by accelerating talents and making 
that talent available to our customers. We are proud of every-
one who has chosen to be part of Acando, of all the initiatives

2 Acando Annual Report 2017 2017 in brief
2017 in brief
In 2017, Acando continued its transition toward becoming northern  
Europe’s leading consulting company. The Group posted sales of over 
SEK 2.4 billion and delivered the highest ever profit in Acando’s history. 
During the year, an increasingly clear trend has become apparent in our 
assignments, namely that the digitalization of products and services  
coordinates with opportunities in traditional business-process-driven IT. 
We are noting increasingly complex value chains and solutions are being 
constructed in shorter times and, at these accelerating speeds, focus on 
user behavior becomes an increasingly important element in how solutions 
are defined and implemented. The pace of change is high, the need for 
innovation greater and the ability of organizations to mature digitally  
and maximize the leverage of their investments is becoming a journey  
of change in itself. 
At Acando, we have a unique, collective ability, whereby we combine deep 
technical expertise with insight into customer and user behavior, and where 
our culture of strong individual ownership and a high collective ability give 
us a unique advantage in how we relate to our customers and partners. 
Altogether, our perception is that we have never been better positioned 
to leverage today’s increasingly rapid digital reality that we live in.

FRONT COVER: In 2012, the three Acando consultants on the cover started a network 
for women – Women@Work. The goal of the network is to provide additional support for 
women at Acando through shared professional activities, to build a cross-departmental 
network and to strengthen the network through creating ties with interesting external 
contacts. During the year, women at Acando were invited to participate in breakfast  
seminars with internal and external speakers. These seminars have often been concluded 
with rewarding and interesting discussions where norms based, in general, on gender 
and work experience were discussed.

FIRST QUARTER, JANUARY–MARCH
  The year started with healthy demand, this being strongest  
in the Swedish and Norwegian markets.
  Acando in Norway signed an agreement to implement  
Dynamics CRM for Isolaft AS. 
  Acando in Finland signed an agreement with YIT for mobile 
solutions.
  The offering in Germany was expanded through a local initia-
tive in Düsseldorf.
  Acando acquired the minor consulting firm Bitec Oy which 
specializes in mobile solutions.
SECOND QUARTER, APRIL–JUNE
  Demand remained in line with earlier levels in all markets in 
which Acando is active. Acando in Sweden entered into a major 
agreement with Fora for support and management of their 
SAP environment. In parallel, a five-year framework agreement 
was signed concerning SAP consulting and project services. 
  Acando in Finland signed an agreement with the Finnish media 
Group Alma Media for SAP. 
  Based on several major framework agreements in Norway and 
Sweden, Acando regularly delivers advanced advisory services 
to the public sector and major global companies. Acando is 
one of the first SAP suppliers in the Nordic region to become 
Partner Center of Expertise certified. 
THIRD QUARTER, JULY–SEPTEMBER
  The market weakened with a slowdown principally affecting 
the markets in Sweden and Finland. Acando in Norway signed 
an agreement with H-Produkter AS to implement a new CRM 
system.
  Management Consulting continued to grow in importance,  
although the healthiest trends were posted by the Strategy & 
Transformation and Supply Chain Management areas, where 
efficiency projects are in high demand. 
  In the Business Systems area, Acando gained new commitments 
from customers including Sapa Norden for work implementing 
Dynamics AX as an ERP platform. 
FOURTH QUARTER, OCTOBER–DECEMBER
  The markets remained cautious, particularly for Acando’s oper-
ations in Sweden and Finland. Other markets in which Acando 
operates have not shown such clear signs of slowing down, 
Germany is in line with the preceding quarters and healthy  
demand continues in Norway. 
  Acando signed a six-year strategic partnership agreement with 
the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service (NAV). The assign-
ment was awarded to a consortium whereby Acando is included 
in the consortium under the French company, Steria. Acando’s 
primary area of responsibility is IT architecture, but the agree-
ment also comprises services from Acando’s entire portfolio in 
Management Consulting and IT Consulting.
  Acando signed a framework agreement with Lantmännen 
Ekonomisk Förening. The Norwegian Association of Authorised 
Accountants (NARF) signed an agreement with Acando for the 
procurement and implementation of a new membership system.
 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2012 1 
 2012 IN BRIEF
2012 IN BRIEF
During the year, Acando has worked with streamlining and distinguishing the market offering. 
Acando’s core offering is divided into three main categories: Business Development, Business 
Systems and IT Solutions, which work together to create measurable results in each customer 
assignment. Acando’s customer promise is to provide sustainable business enhancements 
through information technology. During the year, efforts continued to broaden the customer 
base further, which, in combination with Acando’s geographic strength, resulted in improved 
operating margins compared with preceding years.

 CEO’S REPORT
We have a strong belief in our 
own willingness and ability 
to continue delivering results, 
both for our customers and 
owners.
 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2012 3 
 CEO’S REPORT
2012 – continued improvement in earnings  
in a softening economy
The year was characterized by a robust market in the first half of 
the year followed by softening demand in the second half. In 2012, 
through our breadth in terms of geographical spread, customers 
and services, we have shown that we have the prerequisites for 
robust operations even in a fluctuating economy. We attained 
growth, but the most satisfying of all was the continued increase 
in the operating margin. Group sales of SEK 1,547 m corresponded 
to growth of 3 percent measured in local currency and the operat-
ing margin was 7.4 percent, up half a percentage point. A healthy 
financial position and continued strong cash flow means that the 
Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 1.00 per share, cor-
responding to SEK 71 m, to our shareholders.
Close, Comprehensive and Industrialized as a concept – 
Team Spirit, Passion and Results as the driving forces
Requirements to be met by our customers are escalating. The utili-
zation of technological opportunities as an integrated part of busi-
ness activities has become a decisive issue for increasing numbers 
of customers. In many ways, Acando’s position is unique. Our con-
sultants’ DNA contains an inexhaustible curiosity and in-depth 
knowledge of the opportunities provided by technology in com-
bination with a well-informed understanding of the prerequisites 
for the business activities and long-term strategic direction. But 
first and foremost, there is a passion to deliver clear results from 
this combination in each assignment. Our assignments are based 
on our three strategic cornerstones, close, comprehensive and in-
dustrialized. Closeness to customers creates understanding of the 
unique challenges that often result in us working together in joint 
projects towards well-defined goals. The completeness of our  
offering and the breadth of our competence create the ability to 
select the right solution and the right implementation model, which 
means that we ensure excellent results in all our assignments.
Customers’ trust and the boldness to accept challenges
We are both proud and humbled by the trust shown in us by our 
customers. This applies not least in those contexts where new 
technology, new business models or bold approaches are re-
quired to meet a rapidly changing world. Over the past year, we 
have successfully taken up several major challenges: the definition 
of future-proof IT architecture for enhanced service to citizens, 
mobile solutions for improved customer interaction and enhanced 
efficiency in the service organization, product range and supply 
chain streamlining to increase profitability in the retail sector,  
customer satisfaction strategies for the digital channels of event 
companies, cloud-based financial solutions for enhanced scalability 
in service companies, real-time information analysis for enhanced 
customer experiences in the entertainment industry and much, 
much more. But despite all of the exciting new assignments, I am 
most satisfied that, year after year, we are rated highly by our cus-
tomers, which is a key precondition for our operations. Recurring 
feedback, is that Acando’s consultants are responsive and dedi-
cated as well as knowledgeable and easy to work with. 
To be continued… the course remains set
We continue to develop. In 2012, we widened our customer port-
folio, honed our offering and more than 300 consultants joined 
Acando. Our strategy remains set. We will continue to grow pri-
marily through organic growth in existing geographic markets. 
Success with the above requires the broadening of our offering 
so that we can provide all of our services in the areas of Manage-
ment Consulting, Business Systems and IT in all countries. In addi-
tion, we will continue to widen our customer base and pursue an 
increasing number of project-based deliveries to thereby ensure 
sustainable growth and profitability in a changing economy. 
None of this would be possible without all of our passionate 
consultants. Every day is full of opportunities that our consultants 
give their utmost to capture. My heartfelt thanks to all of you and 
also to Acando’s customers and owners for the trust they have 
placed in us.
We have a strong belief in our own willingness and ability to 
continue delivering results, both for our customers and owners. 
In parallel, we stand humbly in front of the operating environment 
that we all share and a challenging economic climate. 
There is only one direction – forward!
Carl-Magnus Månsson
President and CEO
Acando is well placed! We find ourselves in extraordinary times with accelerating demands to 
interweave technological opportunities with business advantage. Creating sustainable value in 
this manner is both exciting and challenging! At Acando, we are proud of the level of trust placed 
in us by our customers when it comes to us acting as their guide in the most challenging and 
ambitious projects. The assignment awarded to Acando by the Norwegian Labour and Welfare 
Service (NAV) to define the organization’s long-term IT architecture is evidence of the above. This 
is one of the largest public sector modernization programs in the Nordic region, as well as being 
one of Acando’s single largest assignments to date. There is only one direction for us – forward!
FORWARD!

2016 in brief
In 2016, Acando continued its transition toward becoming northern  
Europe’s leading consulting company. The Group posted sales of  
SEK 2.2 billion and delivered the highest ever profit in Acando’s history. 
During the year, an increasingly clear trend has become apparent in  
our assignments, namely that the digitalization of products and services  
coordinates with opportunities in traditional business-process-driven  
IT. We are noting increasingly complex value chains and solutions are 
being constructed in shorter times and, at these accelerating speeds, 
focus on user behavior becomes an increasingly important element in 
how solutions are defined and implemented. The pace of change is high 
and the ability of organizations to mature digitally and maximize the 
leverage of their investments is becoming a journey of change in itself. 
At Acando, we have a unique, collective ability, whereby we combine 
deep technical expertise with insight into customer and user behavior, 
and where our culture of strong individual ownership and a high collective 
ability give us a unique advantage in how we relate to our customers and 
partners. Altogether, our perception is that we have never been better 
positioned to leverage today’s increasingly rapid digital reality that we 
live in.

2 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2013
 2013 in brief
2013 in brief
Acando’s offering is structured as three areas, Management 
Consulting, enterprise solutions and Digital solutions. Acando 
possesses leading-edge skills and is one of the leading  
companies in each individual area. A growing need exists for 
interaction between the operational areas since activities are 
increasingly implemented in projects that engage skills from 
all three areas. the market need for cross-disciplinary solutions 
benefits Acando, since the company’s strength lies in its abil-
ity to combine consultants from differing disciplines to deliver 
one total solution. Acando’s customer promise of sustainable 
business enhancements through information technology 
has rarely been more topical than now, when business activ-
ities are increasingly driving it issues and the digitization of 
work processes has become a reality for most companies.

 ACANDO ANNUAL REPORT 2013 3 
 2013 in brief
2013 in brief FIRST QUARTER, JANUARY–MARCH  The year started weakly and market sentiment was cautious. Customer project implementation decisions are becoming increasingly protracted and procurements are also characterized by more intense competi-tion with more industry players. 
  Acando signed a framework agreement with a Swedish company that is part of a global retail group. The 
agreement applies for a three-year period and comprises Acando’s entire offering in Management and IT 
Consulting services in Sweden and Germany. 
  Acando’s operations in Strategic IT and Business Systems, particularly in the SAP area, reported continued 
healthy demand.
SECOND QUARTER, APRIL–JUNE
  The financial uncertainty prevalent in the company’s markets remained unchanged from the first quarter, 
however, continued robust demand was noted in the Norwegian public sector.
  Acando signed an agreement with Perstorp as implementation partner for the approaching roll-out of 
Perstorp’s SAP solution. 
  In a turnkey delivery for Stockholm South General Hospital (SöS), Acando delivered tools and methods to 
reduce costs for purchasing consumables. 
  Acando launched the Acando Collaboration Platform, an offering that combines the intranet, social media 
and modern document management into one workspace, where the entire organization can participate. 
THIRD QUARTER, JULY–SEPTEMBER
  The uncertainty that characterized the Group’s markets in the first half of the year declined slightly in the 
third quarter and an initial recovery was noted.
  Acando expanded operations in Norway through the acquisition of the Oslo-based consulting company 
E-vita AS with slightly more than 60 employees. E-vita AS provides IT solutions for optimizing business 
processes and, in Norway, is market leader in portals and process solutions using Oracle technology. 
  Acando in Norway signed a framework agreement with the Norwegian Tax Administration for architecture 
and solution definitions as well as integration and modeling, which further strengthened Acando’s posi-
tion in the public sector with focus on advisory services. A framework agreement was signed in Sweden 
with Region Västra Götaland in the Strategy and Management area. 
  Acando launched a Mobile Client app for Microsoft Dynamics CRM in Germany and, thereby, widened the 
product portfolio of mobile CRM clients.
  Management Consulting continued to grow in importance, though the strongest trends were posted by 
the Strategy & Transformation and Supply Chain Management areas, where efficiency projects are in high 
demand.
FOURTH QUARTER, OCTOBER–DECEMBER
  The market recovery became increasingly clear during the quarter, particularly in the Norwegian market 
where projects were now being initiated and previously postponed investments activated.
  In the fourth quarter, Acando signed an agreement with OKQ8 for delivery of a new ERP solution based 
on Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. 
  Acando has also signed agreements, in partnership with a third party, with the Swedish Social Insurance 
Agency to support the agency’s extensive investment in simplifying the sickness benefit process.
  Acando won the assignment to upgrade Moelven Töreboda’s Microsoft Dynamics AX business system 
from version 4.0 to the 2012 version.
  Interest in cloud-based delivery models continues to rise and increasing numbers of Microsoft’s customers 
are actively investigating possibilities of migrating from on-premise IT to cloud-based delivery. 
  The packaging of solutions and their rapid implementation is perceived as becoming increasingly decisive 
for success. Acando has a number of such packages to offer, which when linked to our understanding of 
business-specific requirements provides a unique position.

ANNUAL REPORT 
 
The operations 
 
AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) operates 
under the trademark ice.net in Norway and Net1 in Sweden and Denmark. The business concept is to 
provide telecommunications operator services, including mobile broadband services, telephony and other 
related telecom services. 
 
The service utilizes a unique combination of advanced 3G technology, CDMA2000, and radio transmission 
on the low-frequency band 450 MHz. These combinations are commonly called CDMA450. For our 
customers, this means access to mobile broadband with almost full geographical coverage. The 450MHz 
frequency licenses in Sweden, Norway and Denmark expire in 2020, 2019 and 2022, respectively. 
 
In Norway additional spectrums in the 800MHz, 900MHz and 1800MHz bands were acquired in December 
2013 and the Norwegian business is currently ramping up to become a fully-fledged mobile network 
operator. 
 
The company is wholly owned by AINMT Holdings AB, which is owned to 96,14% by AI Media Holdings 
(NMT) LLC, Delaware. 
 
Significant events during the year 
 
2014 was an important transitional year for AINMT, particularly for the company’s Norwegian operation. 
Although the group delivers a strong EBITDA improvement, our primary focus throughout the year has 
been to build a platform for tomorrow’s AINMT group – a fully-fledged, data-focused operator of 4G 
mobile broadband and, in Norway, smartphone services. 
 
 In Q1 2014, AINMT Group, through AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS, successfully issued a SEK 1,5 
billion High Yield Bond (ISIN NO 001 0705601) at 9,75% interest rate with semi-annual interest 
payments. Settlement date was 19 March 2014; maturity date is 19 March 2019. First interest 
payment was made on 19 September 2014. Part of the bond’s proceeds was used to repay certain 
external loans. 
 
 In connection with the bond issue, AINMT Holdings AB transferred its Scandinavian subsidiaries 
to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS.  
 
 On 1 October 2014, Ice Communication Norge AS and Tele2-owned Mobile Norway AS announced 
an agreement on lease of 5 MHz in the 900 MHz band, from 1 October 2014 to 1 April 2015. 
 
 On 1 October 2014, Ice Communications Norge AS also announced a deal to acquire parts of 
Tele2’s mobile network infrastructure if the Norwegian Competition Authority approved 
TeliaSonera AB’s acquisition of Tele2 in Norway. 
 
 On 11 November 2014 AINMT signed an agreement with Alcatel-Lucent to deploy a 4G LTE and IP 
networking solutions throughout Scandinavia. The network will be rolled out during 2015. 
 
 AINMT’s Swedish operation delivered first positive full year EBITDA.

Non-recurring items identified during 2014 amounts to NOK 27 808 (25 175) thousands. Non-recurring 
items are mainly related to inventory revaluations and restructuring measurements. Non-recurring items 
2013 also holds costs related to international expansions outside Scandinavia.  
 
Significant events after the end of the period 
 
On 5 February 2015, the Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Tele2’s 
Norwegian operation. As a result of the approval, AINMT’s Norwegian operation (ice.net) and TeliaSonera 
announced an agreement that is effective from 1st March 2015 and covers the following:  
 
 ice.net will acquire Network Norway’s business-to-business customer base and the Network 
Norway brand 
 ice.net will acquire Officer AS, Norway’s fastest growing retailer of mobile communication 
solutions, with dealerships throughout Norway 
 ice.net retains an option to acquire the 2100 MHz spectrum, subject to government approval 
 ice.net enters into a six-year national roaming agreement (NRA) with TeliaSonera.  
 A co-location agreement giving ice.net access to TeliaSonera’s sites at beneficial rates and 
conditions 
 
As a result of the Competition Authority approval, Ice Communication Norge AS’s deal to purchase parts of 
Tele2’s mobile network infrastructure was made effective from 5th February 2015.   
 
Future developments 
 
The group continues to invest in network capacity and to simplify and extend the service offers on all 
markets while keeping a tight cost structure. New technical solutions are continuously evaluated, as the 
upgrade to LTE during 2015. AINMT’s Norwegian operation in the space of 15 months has positioned 
itself to develop from a pure-play provider of mobile broadband services to becoming Norway’s third 
largest mobile network operator.  
 
While 2014 was a transitional and foundation-creating year, 2015 will be a year of further developing the 
infrastructure, tools and businesses that we have secured throughout the past 15 months. From March 1st 
2015, we will almost double our revenue base in Norway, where we also start operating as a smartphone 
player. This foundation has put us in a highly interesting challenger position in the Norwegian market, and 
is something we will be able to harvest the results from over the coming years, both in terms of revenue 
and profits. 
 
The company is planning to file for listing the bond on the Oslo Stock Exchange (Oslo Børs) in 2015. 
 
 
AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Annual Report 2014 
Corporate identity nr 913 192 354  Annual Report 
 
  Page 4 (33) 
Operations and cash flows 
 
The group’s operating profit amounted to NOK -63 314 (-21 240) thousands. The main change from 
previous year are the increased license costs in Norway and the main difference between operating profit 
and operating cash flows of NOK 43 321 (25 004) thousands are the large financial expenses and non-cash 
items, mainly caused by unrealized currency fluctuations. 
 
Investments 
 
The Group’s acquisition of intangible assets amounted to NOK 716 867 (3 435) thousands, including the 
acquisition of Ice Communication Norge AS that was awarded the spectrum licences in Norway in 
December 2013. The acquisition of tangible assets amounted to NOK 41 714 (106 390) thousands. 
 
Investments in intangible assets consist of frequency spectrum licences and capitalised costs for research 
and development activities, relating to new technologies and secure full utilization of existing technologies 
and network. Investments in tangible assets are primarily related to network capacity expansions, both on 
existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems. 
 
Financing 
 
The Group is financed through owners’ capital and loans. In Q1 2014, the Group successfully issued a SEK 
1,5 billion High Yield Bond (ISIN NO 001 0705601) at 9,75% interest rate with semi-annual interest 
payments. Settlement date was 19 March 2014; maturity date is 19 March 2019. Part of the bond’s 
proceeds was used to repay certain external loans. 
 
As per the end of 2014, the Group's total assets amounted to NOK 2 537 670 (953 442) thousands of 
which equity amounted to NOK 947 416 (343 357) thousands which gives an equity/assets ratio of 37% 
(36%). 
 
Research and development 
 
During 2014 the main focus has been to select vendor(s) for the new 4G network and CPE suppliers.  
  
Personnel and organization 
 
The average number of employees was 91 versus 78 for the equivalent period the previous year, of which 
73 and 62 respectively were men. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract 
suppliers and subcontractors, the Group employed 126 (90) people. The board of directors has two 
members (all men). 
 
Incentive plans encourage employees to remain loyal to the business. In turn, retaining high quality 
employees saves us money and is good for the long-term development of the company. That is why we in 
Q4 2014 introduced a long-term incentive programme for selected employees in our organisation. The 
programme consists of warrants/employee stock options to purchase shares in the parent company, 
AINMT Holdings AB, with a vesting period of four years. 
 
Work environment 
 
A healthy work environment contributes to a better health, greater engagement and increased job 
satisfaction. The goal is to create a pleasant work environment that contributes to the motivated and 
committed employees, which ultimately is important for the company's continued success. Creating a 
positive and pleasant environment requires continuous effort, and is a natural part of the daily operations.

Ossur’s	year	2006	was	characterized	by	the	introduction	
of	breakthrough	bionic	products	to	the	market,	successful	
acquisitions	and	integration	efforts	following	acquisitions	
made	in	the	past	two	years.
Our	most	complex	R&D	projects	to	date	received	well-de-
served	attention	and	international	recognition.	
In	2006	we	launched	two	bionic	products,	the	PROPRIO	
FOOT™		and	the	POWER	KNEE™,	both	of	which	are	the	
first	of	their	kind	in	the	world.	They	have	been	well	received	
by	the	O&P	community	as	well	as	the	general	public	and	
confirm	Ossur’s	position	as	the	technology	leader	in	the	
prosthetics	industry.	
The	technology	behind	the	bionic	product	line	has	for	the	
second	consecutive	year	has	received	awards	from	Popu-
lar	Science	Magazine	and	Frost	&	Sullivan.	Furthermore,	
The	New	York	Times	 featured	 the	PROPRIO	FOOT™	in	
October	and	made	an	impressive	online	animation	of	the	
function	of	the	foot.	Recognition	and	awards	such	as	these	
are	 important	 for	 us	 and	 inspire	 us	 further	 in	 our	 R&D	
efforts.	
A	few	years	back,	we	decided	to	direct	our	growth	further	
into	 the	 bracing	 and	 support	 sector	 of	 orthopaedics.	 We	
said	that	we	would	focus	on	leveraging	our	technical	plat-
forms,	material	expertise	and	biomechanical	understanding.	
Last	year’s	result	of	these	efforts	is	the	Unloader®	One	knee	
brace,	the	ultimate	in	pain	relief	for	osteoarthritis	patients.	
In	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year	 we	 were	 honoured	 by	 the	
World	Economic	Forum	as	they	selected	Ossur	as	one	of	
the	Technology	Pioneers	of	 2006.	 	 Technology	Pioneers	
are	companies	that	have	been	identified	as	developing	and	
applying	highly	transformational	and	innovative	technolo-
gies	in	various	areas.	The	Forum	brings	together	compa-
nies	that	are	helping	to	shape	not	just	the	future	of	tech-
nology	and	commerce,	but	also	 the	 future	of	our	global	
culture.	It	is	important	that	those	involved	develop	a	better	
understanding	of	one	another.	This	presents	a	unique	op-
portunity	for	Ossur.
In	 last	 year’s	 annual	 report	 we	 published	 our	 goals	 for	
2010	to	expand	the	business	to	USD	750	million	in	sales	
and	an	EBITDA	margin	of	23%.		These	are	ambitious	goals	
and	to	reach	them	we	will	have	to	continue	to	consolidate	
the	market	and	acquire	companies.		Our	strategy	has	been	
to	further	expand	into	the	bracing	and	support	sector	and	
the	larger	field	of	orthopaedics,	as	well	as	strengthen	our	
European	market,	and	we	will	continue	 to	exploit	all	op-
portunities.	
In	January	we	acquired	the	US	company	Innovation	Sports,	
a	manufacturer	of	ligament	braces,	which	positioned	Os-
sur	at	the	leading	edge	in	the	largest	segment	of	the	brac-
ing	and	support	market.	In	December,	we	reached	another	
milestone	when	we	acquired	the	Gibaud	Group	in	France.	
The	Gibaud	Group	is	a	local	leader	in	the	design,	produc-
tion	 and	 distribution	 of	 medical	 devices,	 specializing	 in	
bracing,	 soft	 goods	 and	 compression	 therapy	 products,	
the	latest	being	a	new	product	segment	for	Ossur.		
The	Company	has	changed	dramatically	following	the	ac-
quisitions	 of	 the	 last	 two	 years.	 Ossur	 has	 transformed	
from	being	a	leading	company	in	the	field	of	prosthetics	
into	a	global	non-invasive	orthopaedics	company	and	one	
of	the	major	players	 in	that	 field.	 	We	are	determined	to	
become	the	global	leader	in	non-invasive	orthopaedics.
In	September	we	made	some	organizational	changes	fo-
cusing	on	 three	major	profit	units;	Ossur	Americas,	Os-
sur	Europe	and	Ossur	Asia.	The	organizational	 changes	
accommodate	our	emphasis	on	Asia.	We	opened	a	new	
office	for	Ossur	Asia	in	Shanghai,	China	and	are	looking	
forward	to	building	up	further	sales	and	R&D	activities	in	
the	next	several	years	in	Asia.
Following	our	acquisition	of	Gibaud	we	announced	that	an	
equity	offering	is	planned	to	take	place	during	2007.		In	the	
past	we	have	enjoyed	the	trust	from	our	investors	and	the	
investment	community.	 	 Last	 June	we	 received	 the	Nor-
dic	IR	Awards,	for	best	 investor	relations	by	an	Icelandic	
Company	which	demonstrates	to	us	that	our	commitment	
and	efforts	 in	our	communication	with	 the	 investors	are	
recognized	and	appreciated.		Last	fall	ABG	Sundal	Collier	
initiated	analyst	coverage	of	Ossur	which	is	an	important	
step	in	our	plans	for	future	equity	offerings	and	efforts	in	
attaracting	attention	of	international	investors.																
determination leads to success
3
Our	goals	for	the	future	are	very	ambitious.	We	constantly	
observe	from	the	users	of	our	products	that	determination	
and	focus	on	one’s	ultimate	goal,	coupled	with	hard	work,	
inevitably	lead	to	success.	Take	Oscar	Pistorious,	for	exam-
ple.	Oscar	is	a	20-year-old	double	amputee,	the	world	record	
holder	in	his	category	for	the	100,	200	and	400	meter	sprint.	
His	goal	is	to	compete	against	able-bodied	athletes	in	the	
2008	Olympic	Games.	Oscar	is	using	Ossur’s	running	legs	
to	achieve	this	goal,	and	we	are	proud	of	our	contribution	
to	his	achievements.	Sponsoring	outstanding	achievers	like	
Oscar	and	others	on	Team	Ossur,	as	well	as	maintaining	
close	contact	with	our	users,	is	very	rewarding	and	confirms	
that	anything	is	possible	when	one’s	mind	is	set.	
2006	was	a	year	of	integration	and	restructuring	but	also	
one	 of	 great	 technological	 accomplishments.	 We	 are	
proud	of	our	efforts	and	look	optimistically	to	the	future,	
committed	 to	 further	achievements	 that	will	 continue	 to	
deliver	successful	outcomes	for	all	of	our	stakeholders.

operating prospects
The Company will continue to be profitable and create strong cash flow going forward. Ossur has a strong 
balance sheet and secured long term financing, which makes the Company well positioned in case of a 
prolonged economic downturn. Management estimates, based on the assumptions that Ossur’s core 
markets stay relatively unaffected, a modest growth in local currency and similar EBITDA levels as 2008. 
The Company´s strong market share, infrastructure and its sound financials makes it well equipped to 
take advantage of potential market opportunities that might emerge from recent turmoil.

solid steps
This past year the world witnessed extreme economic 
 turmoil. While not immune to slowdowns, Ossur 
 operates within the healthcare sector, which has limited 
sensitivity to economic fluctuations. Our operational 
environment is rather stable and therefore the negative 
developments in the financial markets have not had a 
significant impact on our underlying business. In fact, 
Iceland’s much publicized economic woes have had  little 
impact on our operations. However, if we see a continued 
economic downturn, it’s impossible to  predict if and how 
the economy will affect the healthcare sector. 
But our commitment to the Company’s main  principles will 
help us thrive. Ossur’s corporate structure is  characterized 
by initiative, ambition, drive and  cooperation. The 
 Company’s core values honesty, frugality and  courage are 
the foundation upon which we build our work. 
Our objective is to continue as a leader in the non-invasive 
orthopaedics market. To maintain our reputation as a 
market leader and to achieve Company goals, we must 
not only stay focused on all aspects of the orthopaedics 
industry, but seek out opportunity and innovation. 
3 annual report 08
solid steps
In 2005, Ossur became a significant player in the bracing 
and support market of orthopaedics. Three years later, we 
are a market leader in bracing and supports. Ossur has 
seen sales grow on average 30% annually over the past 
five years. To continue growing successfully, we must 
make sure Company fundamentals are solid, because 
it is our values that inspire us, and ensure company 
growth, which not only increases profitability, but also 
achieves our overriding mission: enabling customers to 
live life without limitations. 
Like a child, a company often grows faster than it matures. 
Ossur has experienced rapid growth, which is why in 
2008 we took time to mature by focusing on internal 
projects and processes. After acquisitions within the 
Americas division, Ossur had over 300 new employees. 
We needed to reorganize our sales team and practices, 
make sure everyone was in tune with Company values. 
While we still have some growing pains, by focusing 
on product rationalization and by using the synergies 
created through our acquisitions, profitability increased 
dramatically in 2008. We will continue to focus on our 
internal projects and position ourselves to be able to 
exploit future opportunities that await the Company.
Ossur invests in Research and Development to make 
sure we continue to produce cutting-edge products. 
This investment can open new doors to opportunities. 
One new opportunity is advanced wound care, which in 
the first quarter of 2008 was divested. Our R&D saw an 
opportunity and using the material know-how we have 
with silicone technology, created a new wound care 
product. To be able to design and manufacture a new 
product line, not in the core area of our business, further 
confirms the strength of our research and development 
team and underpins our commitment to invest in R&D 
activities. 
A steady pipeline of products and sustained technological 
leadership in our core competencies are on our agenda 
for next year. Continued investment in our patented and 
proprietary know-how – silicone, carbon composites, 
textiles and cutting edge bionic technology – will produce 
new and better products as we advance towards the new 
decade. And we will take care to ensure our innovations 
fit within current reimbursement systems, broadening 
access to these effective solutions.  
Enabling people to live life without limitations is not 
just a phrase. It’s a commitment. So it brought us great 
pleasure to watch the Paralympic Games, hosted by 
Beijing this past September. As usual, members of Team 
Ossur returned home with countless medals and lasting 
memories of an amazing event. All of us at Ossur are 
extremely proud of them. One of those heroes also made 
it onto another high-profile platform. Oscar Pistorius 
was named as one of the most 100 influential people in 
the world by TIME magazine, and he continues to inspire 
and motivate people all over the world.

Generation II
The major Ossur milestone of the year was the acquisition of the Generation II Group, which
specializes in the design and manufacture of knee braces.
The acquisition represents an important breakthrough in Ossur's expansion into the orthotics market,
as the operations of the Generation II companies meshes well with Ossur's. The structure and future
vision of the companies are similar, and this translates into numerous opportunities for joint utilization
of technology, production facilities and marketing networks.

full speed ahead
We at Ossur are spurred on by ambition, one of the 
many traits within our company culture. Our vision 
for the future is clear. Our rise to leadership within the 
prosthetic industry serves as motivation towards the 
Company’s transformation and it is obvious that those 
who contribute have to do their utmost every step 
of the way.  We are confident that we will accomplish 
what we have set out to do.  We intend to maintain our 
technical leadership, achieve sales and operational cost 
leadership, continue consolidating through acquisitions, 
maintain our profitability, ensure a positive customer 
experience, and further the Ossur culture.
Following numerous acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, we 
have focused on optimizing our bracing and supports 
sales efforts, and strengthening our infrastructure and 
brand awareness within the areas of orthopaedics where 
we are active.  We have used the year to further restruc-
ture and consolidate our organization to be better pre-
pared for the changes we envision and to  fully leverage 
the  synergies from past acquisitions.
Ossur operates within the healthcare sector which has 
limited sensitivity to economic fluctuations. Our op-
erational environment is rather stable and therefore the 
negative developments in the financial markets last year 
did not have any significant impact on the underlying 
business of the Company. 
We think of ourselves as innovation leaders. We strive 
to eliminate the physical limitations caused by certain 
disabilities and make the technology available to a larger 
group of people. Our design teams listen to the market 
demands and utilize their expertise to deliver products 
that fulfill the expectations of our partners, customers, 
and users.
We opened the Ossur Asia office in Shanghai in 2006. 
During that first year, our Asian team started building 
relationships and market knowledge and we will 
continue to build on the vast opportunities that are open 
to us there. It was a great personal pleasure for me to 
meet our many partners in China during the Ossur Asia 
inauguration ceremony last October.
I am looking forward to the Paralympic year of 2008. 
Ossur supports teams and athletes all over the world 
and I follow and admire their many achievements. I have 
known some of the athletes since their childhood, like 
athlete Rudy Garcia-Tolson. Even as a small boy, Rudy 
set his mind on making the U.S. Paralympic Team. His 
spirit and optimism is a source of endless inspiration for 
everyone who has ever met him. For example last year, 
Rudy broke his own world record at the U.S. Paralympic 
Open Swimming Championships. His journey is one 
of the many I will be following at the Paralympics in 
China with great interest. Another extraordinary young 
athlete is Oscar Pistorius, who, on his two carbon fiber 
feet, has challenged the frontiers dividing disabled 
and able-bodied. Oscar’s dream is to compete in the 
Olympics. Despite the recent ruling by the International 
Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) banning him 
from competing along side able-bodied athletes in IAAF 
events, Ossur will continue to support Oscar’s bid for 
equality.
Our work has, much like in previous years, not gone un-
noticed in 2007 by a wide audience. In November, Forbes 
Magazine featured Ossur in an article focusing on the 
Company’s rapid growth and future product develop-
ment in the area of functional bracing. Our PROPRIO 
FOOT® won the 2007 Gold Medical Design Excellence

life changing  
technologies
The turbulent global economic environment has been felt in different ways. For many, 
there have been new challenges and tough times over the course of this past year. 
However, I am pleased to report that Össur has maintained a steady and profitable 
operation throughout 2009. Our commitment to the Company’s main principles—
honesty, frugality and courage—will help us continue to thrive. The Company’s core 
values are the foundation upon which we operate. Promoting “Life Without Limitations” 
remains the Company’s foremost aspiration.
One of the Company’s cornerstones is innovation. Our constant commitment to 
more effective designs, technologies and outcomes has enabled us to maintain our 
technical leadership in the field of prosthetics. We have already introduced three 
Bionic products to the market. Our Bionic products utilize artificial intelligence to 
sense the user’s motion, allowing the prosthesis to react in real time. Össur’s Bionic 
products have received various awards and recognition over the past few years. The 
new RHEO KNEE® is now a second-generation design, featuring our breakthrough 
Bionic Technology. This life-changing technology is unmatched by any other company 
and we continue to explore its potential with great excitement. The Bionic product 
PROPRIO FOOT® has now been issued a reimbursement code that will be active in 
the US in 2010. This is a major milestone for the sales of the product. These new 
innovations, like Bionic Technology, come about because of Össur’s commitment to 
research and development. This commitment ensures that we will continue to produce 
cutting-edge products that promote comfort, control, better mobility and high quality 
of life.
Össur has grown through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, 
with 14 acquisitions having been completed over the past 10 years. We operate in 14 
different locations around the globe, maintaining a well-balanced sales split between 
the US and European markets.
In September, the Company was listed on NASDAQ OMX 
Copenhagen, and following the listing, a successful new 
shares offering was conducted. Since our initial listing in 
Iceland, Össur has transformed into a global company 
and it was a logical next step to list the Company in 
Copenhagen. At the end of the year just over 50% of our 
share capital was held by foreign investors. The additional 
listing in Copenhagen will facilitate trade, fair pricing of 
our shares and strengthen the Company’s foundation 
for future growth. As a symbol of the Company’s global 
standing, in November we were honored to be invited 
to ring the NASDAQ stock market closing bell in New 
York City. This symbolic event marked Össur’s tenth 
year of trading publically on NASDAQ OMX Iceland, 
and also commemorated our new listing on NASDAQ 
OMX Copenhagen.
I would like to thank the investors for supporting the 
Company’s mission. This year’s performance will ensure 
this level of support continues. Investor support also 
allows us to re-invest a significant proportion of our 
revenues into R&D to maximize future innovations.
Our aim, at all times, is to exceed our customers’ 
expectations by delivering the products and services 
that will help them achieve their goals. At Össur, 
“Life Without Limitations” is more than a slogan; it has 
been our passion for close to 40 years. It is a philosophy 
that permeates every aspect of the business, from R&D 
to products and services. On a personal note, watching 
the progress of people like Rudy Garcia-Tolson, the 
young American sportsman and role model who 
recently became the first double below-knee amputee to 
complete an “Ironman”, and the incredible UK athlete 
Richard Whitehead who is the amputee World Record

Our mission is to improve people’s mobility. Each 
day we see the dramatic impact our products have on 
people’s quality of life. Whether they are Paralympic

“  Overall, 2009 was a positive year for the Group: we both captured market share and increased earnings, while preparing 
the company for growth in the coming years.   ”

Having seen consolidation and mergers among manufacturers 
for a number of years, the hearing aid industry saw further con-
solidation put to an effective stop in 2006 when the German 
competition authorities prevented Sonova from taking over 
GN ReSound. Thus, the only reasons preventing the industry 
from realising the economies of scale that one or more mergers 
could generate are mere formalities, and this has spurred sev-
eral manufacturers to shift or expand their focus. At William 
Demant Holding, we have, through the establishment of Oticon 
Medical,  opted to pursue so-called implantable bone-anchored 
hearing solutions – and we have high expectations of this fi eld. 
Moreover, hearing aid manufacturers increasingly distribute 
their products directly to end-users – a trend we expect to con-
tinue. William Demant Holding too has been involved in distri-
bution activities in specifi c markets for many years, starting 
with the acquisition of Hidden Hearing in 2000. We have built 
up considerable expertise in operating this type of business 
and have even succeeded in generating higher growth in recent 
years than the underlying market.
Our activities in the market for audiometers and other diag-
nostic instruments for hearing and balance measurement, for 
example, has become increasingly signifi cant both in terms of 
such activities’ share of corporate revenues and in terms of their 
contribution to the Group’s earnings. Today, we are the world’s 
largest manufacturer of audiological equipment and operate in 
all global markets, offering some of the most prominent brands: 
Grason-Stadler, Interacoustics, Maico and Amplivox.
Here at the beginning of 2010, we look very much forward to 
the year ahead: we emerged from 2009 with forward momen-
tum, we started the year by launching a groundbreaking high-
end product, and we expect our market share to continue to 
increase in 2010. We thus foresee 3-5% higher growth in 2010 
than the growth rate in the hearing aid market, thereby boost-
ing our market share by about 1 percentage point worldwide 
when also including the impact of our acquisition of distribution 
activities. Both Oticon and Bernafon were selected as suppliers 
to Veterans Affairs (VA) in the USA at the end of 2009, and they 
have enjoyed an excellent start to their cooperation – a coope-
ration that we expect will support our growth forecast for 2010.

Dear reader
At the outset of 2009, the hearing aid industry found itself on 
very shaky ground. In the second half of 2008, the market re-
gistered the fi rst outright drop in hearing aid sales in many 
years, and the market outlook was particularly bleak after the 
fourth quarter. Consequently, we entered 2009 with a certain 
amount of trepidation: would the market continue to fall, would 
the situation stabilise, or would we again experience actual 
growth? The fi rst six months of 2009 showed that the market 
had not revived – but neither had it collapsed, as is the case 
in many other industries. For years, market analysts have dis-
cussed the industry’s sensitivity to economic fl uctuations. 
After the worst fi nancial crisis in many years, I believe we can 
conclude that the industry has pulled through reasonably well, 
and that the hearing aid market has proved resistant, even to 
major fl uctuations in the global economy. 
The start of 2009 proved an uncertain and diffi  cult time for 
William Demant Holding too. In the second half of 2008, we 
recorded declining sales and earnings for the fi rst time in 15 
years. However, we managed to reverse the sales trend, with 
earnings in the fi rst half of 2009 already signifi cantly higher 
than in the second half of 2008. Overall, 2009 was a positive 
year for the Group: we both captured market share and in-
creased earnings, while preparing the company for growth 
in the coming years. 
The fi rst quarter of 2010 will see the launch of Oticon Agil, a 
Premium product offering several unprecedented user benefi ts, 
including further improved wireless features. The instrument 
takes speech understanding in noisy surroundings to a new 
level, which means that the user will use fewer resources on 
listening, thus releasing energy to be used for other important 
tasks such as social interaction. 
Being a frontrunner with the introduction of wireless products 
has been an exciting challenge for the Group’s hearing aid ac-
tivities. We have successfully established a new standard for 
connectivity – the connection of hearing aids with external, 
electronic equipment such as landline and mobile phones, 
televisions and MP3 players. It has been a great challenge to 
get the technology to function properly and to establish it in 
the market, but we feel that we have been quite successful in 
our endeavours. I am therefore convinced that we are now 
well ahead of our competitors, particularly when it comes to 
wireless solutions.

making a difference
Another inspiring and productive year has passed. As always, we have worked closely 
with our customers and partners to make Life Without Limitations a reality for more 
people than ever before – and we couldn’t ask for a more satisfying job. The financial 
results for 2010 reveal the strength of Össur, and show that the Company’s operations 
are sound.
In the bracing and supports arena, we were delighted to introduce a number of exciting 
new products during the year, including the Rebound® Air Walker. Also introduced 
were the Miami J® Advanced and the Miami Lumbar®, both part of an effective spinal 
immobilization system.
In prosthetics, Össur’s Bionic Technology continues to close the gap between human 
and artificial limbs. Our electronic and engineering specialists have been busy 
enhancing intelligent solutions, such as the PROPRIO FOOT® and the RHEO KNEE®, 
and our specialists are putting the finishing touches on the second-generation of 
POWER KNEE™, commercially available in 2011. Other new designs and innovations 
within our mechanical range include a new Flex-Foot® design that effectively offers the 
freedom to work, rest and play without having to change feet – the Re-Flex Rotate™ 
with EVO™. And I’m pleased to report that the Total Knee® range has also been 
updated.
The business is well diversified across the US and Europe with a growing presence in 
Asia. As part of our expanding global network, we were excited to establish a new base 
in South Africa this past year. Another relatively new development was our listing on 
the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen stock exchange in September 2009. The listing has 
proven to be the right step for the Company, and we enjoy a diversified shareholder 
base. When we celebrated the first anniversary of our listing, our share price had 
increased by almost 100%.
We continue to build for the future by increasing efficiency, and positioning our 
company for further growth. Today, we maintain a strong market position and can 
point to positive industry growth drivers in our major 
markets. In the coming years, Össur is well positioned to 
lead the evolution of our industry, and make a difference 
for our customers, shareholders, employees and the 
communities around us. Success is a journey. At Össur, 
we are proud of our past, and excited about our future. 
As we serve our customers, innovate and create new 
solutions we keep in mind the importance of our shared 
corporate values - honesty, frugality and courage - that 
serve as the foundation for the Company’s success.
Össur’s mission is to improve people’s mobility. This 
mission is a passion shared by all of our employees. One 
of our customers who has inspired us to reach higher 
is Richard Whitehead, an outstanding international 
athlete and role model from the UK, who is also a 
bilateral amputee. Together we remain committed to 
Life Without Limitations.
Jón Sigurðsson
President & CEO
“Össur is well positioned to lead the evolution of our industry, and make a difference for our customers, 
shareholders, employees and the communities around us.”
On Sunday 10.10.10, Richard completed the Chicago 
marathon in an astonishing two hours, 42 minutes 
and 52 seconds – the world’s fastest marathon 
time for a lower-limb amputee. Not content with 
the two-hour improvement on his debut marathon 
dating back to 2004, Richard’s ambition is now 
to shave a further seven minutes off his finish 
time in order to compete in the T46 class for arm 
amputees at the Paralympic Games in London 2012. 
There is no class for leg amputees.

first generation of wireless hearing aids back in 2007,  
we have noted a marked increase in demand. As the 
individual manufacturers have furthermore decided to 
invest in developing their own wireless platforms, and as 
the manufacturers are furthermore at varying stages of 
development, the industry has now entered an era where 
manufacturers can truly stand out in terms of products.  
I am convinced that our massive investment in wireless 
technologies for hearing aids and our strong support con- 
cept for good loyal customers have given us a good head 
start that is clearly manifest now, but will also stand us in 
good stead for many years to come. 
Fortunately, the Group’s renewed growth momentum does 
not stem from Oticon Agil alone. Thanks to a wealth of  
other product introductions – among them Oticon Safari  
for children and the Super Power hearing aid, Chili – the 
product portfolios in our hearing aid businesses are cur- 
rently more comprehensive and competitive than ever be- 
fore. Likewise, Bernafon’s numerous launches in recent 
years have significantly reinforced the Bernafon brand,  
an enhancement that has also boosted Bernafon’s sales.
Our distribution power in the hearing aid field also intensi-
fied in the past year. With the acquisition of Otix Global and 
thus the Sonic brand towards the end of 2010, we acquired  
a third brand of hearing aids to supplement the Oticon and 
Bernafon brands. Each with its own unique profile, the three 
brands give us a solid growth platform for better addressing 
different customer needs in future. Acquiring Otix Global 
has naturally presented us with a major integration and 
restructuring challenge. We have laid a detailed plan for  
this work which is already well underway. 
I am also pleased to report that in 2010 we managed to 
successfully establish Oticon Medical as a serious player  
in the market for bone-anchored hearing systems. In this 
area too, we have proved that with the right combination  
of audiological and technological insight, we can create 
products that set entirely new standards for user benefits. 
Dear reader
2010 was a landmark year for the William Demant Holding 
Group, the year in which we regained our position as the 
industry’s fastest-growing player. I am proud of our im- 
pressive growth in 2010, which is solid proof that we have 
emerged stronger from the rather challenging years from 
2007-2009. During this period, we saw decent growth and 
also captured market shares, although not to the full height 
of our ambitions and historic capabilities. In 2010, it was 
therefore particularly satisfying to note that the Group was 
firmly back on the growth track – and so convincingly that 
no peer company could rival us.  
Obviously, numerous factors have contributed to this suc- 
cess, and the spring introduction of the Premium product 
Oticon Agil undeniably played a significant part. From the 
outset, high demand propelled Agil to a ranking as the 
world’s best-selling high-end hearing aid in just a few 
months. The response from all markets and distribution 
channels the world over was the same: with Agil, we had 
raised the bar for sound quality and wireless features. 
During the year, many of our competitors also launched  
new products in the Premium segment, but in our opinion, 
none of these products has to date equalled the perfor-
mance and user benefits offered by Oticon Agil.
The Agil launch clearly shows that the right combination of 
new audiological concepts, user-friendly wireless features, 
modern compact design, a strong global distribution net- 
work and well-established partnerships with worldwide 
hearing care professionals can create the product triumph 
that all hearing aid manufacturers strive for, but only few 
achieve. The absolute winners are of course the thousands 
of hearing-impaired Agil users who have experienced a 
distinct improvement in their hearing and thus a signifi- 
cant boost in life quality. 
However, the Agil success has also shown that wireless 
technology in hearing aids is no longer a new and untested 
innovation to which hearing care professionals and end- 
users must first grow accustomed. Since we launched our 
p Broadly embedded growth bodes well for the future

“ On balance, the Group is currently very well  
positioned. This was reflected in solid growth  
in the past year, and I am certain that also in future, 
our many activities will enable us to continue to  
record excellent growth rates.”
Although we have only just embarked on this long journey,  
I foresee considerable growth in this new business activity 
in the coming years.
Diagnostic Instruments has also made a highly positive 
contribution to corporate growth. In 2010, this business  
activity generated revenues surpassing the half-billion 
kroner mark for the first time, making us by far the largest 
player in the market for audiometers and diagnostic equip- 
ment. With the industry’s largest and most dedicated de- 
velopment department and four strong brands – Grason-
Stadler, Interacoustics, Maico and Amplivox – we are well 
armed to continue capturing market shares.
As far as Personal Communications is concerned, our joint 
venture in the headset area, Sennheiser Communications,  
is truly back on the growth track after a few weak years 
characterised by unfavourable market conditions. Senn-
heiser Communications is in full swing preparing the com- 
pany to take part in the growth expected in the market  
for professional headsets – growth that will be driven by 
Unified Communications (UC). This overarching concept 
covers the integration of a huge range of communication 
tools, including e-mail, mobile phones, landline phones, 
video conferencing equipment and on-line messaging. The 
massive focus on this area has spurred Sennheiser Com-
munications to enter cooperation agreements and strategic  
alliances with leading UC suppliers and to this end, the com- 
pany is also working on getting its products certified. 
 
On balance, the Group is currently very well positioned.  
This was reflected in solid growth in the past year, and I am 
certain that also in future, our many activities will enable us 
to continue to record excellent growth rates. As a natural 
parallel, we continuously strive to develop the company  
so we can deliver high growth effectively and with a clear 
focus. I am therefore confident that the Group is geared to 
continue on the positive course taken in 2010.

4 strong growth in a stable market
that together accommodate the full spectrum of customers 
and their individual needs. Finally, Oticon Medical’s bone-
anchored hearing systems, which are being successfully in-
troduced in an increasing number of markets, help us meet 
practically every need for hearing solutions in the market. In 
that connection, I am pleased to note that at the end of 2011 
– after just two years on the market – Oticon Medical is now 
making a positive contribution to consolidated operating 
earnings. 
All these developments are a refl ection of so-called micro-
segmentation – a phenomenon that is here to stay and will 
undoubtedly put added pressure on smaller players because 
the costs of being at the cutting edge never cease to rise. 
To illustrate this point, it is worth noting that the William 
Demant Group’s consolidated growth in revenues in 2010 
and 2011 corresponds to the revenue generated by one of 
the industry’s smaller players. Granted, certain acquisitions 
have contributed to the growth we have achieved, but in fact, 
organic growth accounts for over half of the Group’s total in-
crease in revenues in 2010 and 2011. 
However, ”just” having good products is no longer enough. 
To become the preferred supplier of hearing care professio-
nals, a manufacturer must also be able to offer a complete 
package of services such as training, counselling tools, 
software as well as marketing materials and marketing 
cooperation. The quality of these services varies conside-
rably from manufacturer to manufacturer, which is why 
these services make it possible to further position each 
individual brand – a potential that we have done much to 
exploit in recent years. 
Investors and analysts seem preoccupied with issues like 
economic decline, consumer reluctance and the risk of re-
cession. Specifi cally, they seem to fear that the uncertain 
macro-economic forecasts will curb end-users’ desire to buy 
hearing aids. Nonetheless, I honestly believe that this fear 
is baseless, as there is no obvious historical correlation be-
tween general economic trends and the demand for hearing 
aids. The population of potential end-users is developing 
steadily and predictably and will continue to do so for dec-
ades to come. Moreover, most hearing aids are bought with-
out any form of subsidy, which means that, unlike other med-
tech industries, the hearing aid industry is relatively un-
touched by health reforms and budget cuts. In our industry, 
it is thus very important for both individual manufacturers 
and the market as a whole to keep abreast of product cycles.
StronG GroWtH In a StaBle MarKet
Dear reader
2011 was another good year for the William Demant Group. 
So good in fact that our wholesale of hearing aids generated 
unit growth of no less than 17%, an advance that has en-
abled us to maintain our position as the industry’s fastest-
growing company and once again to capture signifi cant 
market shares. Volume growth in the underlying market 
amounted to just under 4%, which falls within the custom-
ary growth pattern. In other words, the hearing aid market 
seems essentially unaffected by the general economic 
slowdown.
The Group’s other two business activities, Diagnostic Instru-
ments and Personal Communication, also performed well 
in 2011. As well as generating strong organic growth, Diag-
nostic Instruments further consolidated its activities by ac-
quiring distribution businesses in the US market. Growth in 
Personal Communication was driven by Sennheiser Commu-
nications, which again realised high, double-digit, organic 
growth. 
I am certain that our success lies chiefl y in our long-standing 
focus on technology, innovation and product development 
coupled with our close partnership with primary customers, 
i.e. dispensers and hearing care professionals. 
I would even venture to say that ours is defi nitely the strong-
est and most up-to-date product programme in the industry. 
Carrying every conceivable model variant, Oticon’s portfolio 
in particular offers customers products that are probably se-
cond to none in the industry. 
The ultra-fast, sophisticated RISE 2 platform is the engine 
driving the steady stream of products that have been rolling 
onto the market since spring 2010. The Intiga family will be 
enhanced further in spring 2012, when Oticon launches its 
fi rst IIC instrument (Invisible Inside the Canal) called Intigai.
This advanced technology has enabled us to set new stan-
dards for what hearing care professionals and end-users can 
expect in modern hearing aids in terms of sound quality and 
features. These advances are primarily the result of dedicat-
ed development projects conducted in the fi eld of wireless 
technology since 2000.  
In acquiring the US hearing aid brand Sonic that comple-
ments the Group’s two other brands – Danish Oticon and 
Swiss Bernafon – we now boast three hearing aid brands 
5strong growth in a stable market
Finally, I would like to extend a warm thank you to all our 
highly skilled and committed employees whose determina-
tion over the past three years has helped put the Group back 
on the growth track. Thanks to their tireless efforts, in 2012 
the William Demant Group stands very strong and equipped 
to take on the competition.

Oticon Medical continues to capture market share in the 
market for bone-anchored hearing solutions. Based on a 
highly competitive product programme and intense dialogue 
with surgeons worldwide, Oticon Medical has, in just a few 
years, captured a quarter of the world market. Personally,  
I find it hard to disguise my enthusiasm for the major growth 
potential inherent in Oticon Medical – in both the short and 
the long term.
With almost a quarter of the world hearing aid market based 
on three strong brands, hearing aids will indeed remain the 
mainstay of our activities for many years to come. And if we 
continue to be successful in the area of bone-anchored hear- 
ing solutions, Oticon Medical will be able to continue to ex- 
pand its position in future. To this should of course be added 
that the Group has also established itself as the world’s lead- 
ing and by far largest manufacturer of diagnostic equipment 
for audiological use. Boasting the industry’s widest range  
of brands and products as well as a global market share  
now approaching 40%, Diagnostic Instruments now stands 
stronger than ever before –  
solidly underpinned by the 
acquisition of distribution 
activities in the USA in recent 
years. 
Overall, I am therefore con- 
fident that among hearing  
aid manufacturers, we are exceptionally well positioned,  
as regards both the present competitive situation and our 
ability to generate growth and win market share in the  
longer term. Our ability to exploit technology, knowledge 
and expertise across the Group’s closely related – but 
nonetheless vastly different – business activities is crucial  
to our success now and into the future. Also, it is essential 
that we are always ready for change, thus ensuring that all 
our Group’s activities are continually organised in the best 
and most efficient manner – which is particularly important 
in the current market climate of increasingly keen competi-
tion and price pressure.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank every 
member of our global workforce of skilled and committed 
employees. A few years ago, we got the Group back on the 
growth track, and also in 2012, where market conditions 
were tougher than usual for us, everyone made an extra-
ordinary effort. Not only in 2013, but certainly also in the 
years to come, our many new products, initiatives and 
growth opportunities will continue to demand unwaver- 
ing commitment and willingness to go the extra mile.  
The William Demant Group’s position in 2013 among the 
strongest and most competitive players in the industry  
is in no small part thanks to the efforts of its employees.

“For the year as a whole, we
generated unit growth in the corporate 
wholesale of hearing aids just exceeding 
market growth, but, as everyone knows,
we aim much higher”
Dear reader,
After two years of strong growth in both revenue and earn- 
ings, the Group saw more modest success in 2012. However, 
this development may not be such a surprise after all, given 
the fact that in 2010 and 2011, we were able to generate over- 
all unit growth of almost 30% in the wholesale of Group-
manufactured hearing aids in a market that grew by a mere 
3-4% annually during this period.
The impressive curve that we have followed since the begin- 
ning of 2010 can undoubtedly be traced to the significant 
strengthening of Oticon’s product programme that was 
kickstarted by the launch of the Premium family, Oticon  
Agil, which also marked the beginning of a new platform  
and product cycle. The sturdy sales growth in 2010 and 2011 
enabled us to increase Group revenue by more than DKK 2.3 
billion in total and against this backdrop deliver a rise in ope-
rating profit (EBIT) of approximately DKK 300 million in each 
of the two years.
2012 was thus our third year 
with the successful RISE 2 
platform, but also a year in 
which we focused our attention 
on finalising the next techno-
logical platform and thus pre- 
paring for another line-up of 
groundbreaking products, starting in January 2013 with  
the Premium family called Oticon Alta. However, with only  
a few product launches in the past year, tough comparative 
figures and keener price competition, we faced special chal- 
lenges in 2012. In addition, difficult market conditions in 
several countries left their mark on the year, particularly  
the second half.  
Partly driven by strong product offerings in the mid-priced 
and low-end segments towards the end of the individual 
manufacturers’ product cycles, downward mix shifts in the 
market contributed to putting average selling prices under 
pressure in the past year. At the same time, we saw changes 
in subsidy schemes and aggressive tendering rounds also 
affecting prices unfavourably. 
For the year as a whole, we generated unit growth in the 
corporate wholesale of hearing aids just exceeding market 
growth, but, as everyone knows, we aim much higher: With 
the launch in early January of a brand new technological 
platform called Inium and the introduction of the promising 
Premium family, Oticon Alta, we have embarked on the next 
platform and product cycle, which is certain to generate re- 
newed momentum for the Group in 2013. The first feedback 
on Alta from dispensers and end-users alike has been ex- 
tremely positive, so I am confident that we will be able to 
capture market share again in 2013.

Dear reader,
With Oticon’s introduction of a new technological platform, 
Inium, in early 2013 and also the launch of a new Premium 
family called Oticon Alta, our largest hearing aid brand em-
barked on a new journey offering not only a new platform, 
but also a new product portfolio, both of which generated 
renewed momentum for the Group. Alta became an important 
growth driver in 2013, and we succeeded in substantially in- 
creasing our market share in the Premium segment of the 
market. Now at the beginning of 2014, Oticon has almost 
completed the renewal of its entire product portfolio with 
the launch of new Inium-based hearing instru-
ment families in basically all product seg- 
ments and at all price points. Also, both 
Bernafon and Sonic now benefit from 
having updated product portfolios. 
The second half of 2013 turned out to 
be what is probably the busiest launch 
period the Group has ever had. Thus, 
2013 proved to be an important turning 
point for the Group after a difficult 2012 
where we suffered under a partly outdated 
product portfolio and tough comparative figures.  
2014 is expected to be another good year for the Group, as all 
our business activities are well-positioned for further growth.
To enhance our hearing healthcare activities, we decided 
to enter the cochlear implant market by acquiring the French 
manufacturer Neurelec in 2013. This is a major milestone for 
the Group, as this acquisition has significantly cemented our 
position as one of the world’s strongest hearing healthcare 
companies. Our main ambition is to have the industry’s 
broadest and deepest product offering that covers all aspects 
of hearing care; is based on true innovation; is delivered to 
customers and end-users through a multi-brand approach 
and is backed by a comprehensive global distribution set-up 
and efficient shared services.
By acquiring Neurelec, we got access to know-how, skills, 
technologies and a strong platform for fully implantable 
hearing solutions in a market segment characterised by sig- 
nificant, long-term growth potential. The decision to acquire 
Neurelec was the natural continuation of our successful efforts 
in bone-anchored hearing systems – an area in which we have, 
within a few years, captured more than a quarter of the world 
market.
However, the size of our investment in Neurelec, which 
amounted to DKK 428 million, does not really reflect the  
actual strategic importance of this acquisition to the Group 
as a whole. With a global market share of just 2% at the time 
of acquisition, we are obviously not a market leader in the field 
of cochlear implants, but we now have a solid platform to grow 
from, so in the longer run, the clear goal is to become one of 
the leading players in cochlear implants. The fact that we now 
have the potential to benefit from the solid growth rates to be 
found in the cochlear implant field in the next many years and 
thus to significantly outgrow the cochlear implant market will 
strengthen the Group’s overall growth profile, but will, not 
surprisingly, dilute our profitability at the beginning. Over 
time, Neurelec is however expected to generate a profit ratio 
which will at least be on a par with the profitability ratio de- 
livered by the Group’s other business activities.
All in all, the three major business areas, i.e. traditional 
hearing aids, implantable devices and diagnostic instru-
ments, complement each other in the best possible way. 
Our Group is now the company in the world with 
the strongest offering of hearing solutions 
and equipment for the measurement and 
treatment of hearing loss. The Group 
thus has a unique position in terms 
of alleviation of all kinds of hearing 
losses. 
Over time, we expect to harvest signifi-
cant synergies from this unique position, 
especially in research and development, but also 
in areas such as manufacturing and global wholesale dis-
tribution, and also from cross-selling between our business 
activities. Overall, we feel that we are in a strong position to 
meet our long-term strategic ambition. Also, we have gained 
a strong foothold in a number of markets, when it comes to 
fitting hearing instruments through our own network of 
hearing clinics.
In general, it is important to acknowledge that with a some-
what weak growth outlook for the traditional hearing instru-
ment market, if measured in value, we have in part redirected 
our investment focus and investment capacity towards other 
areas within hearing healthcare. Obvious examples are our 
entry into the markets for bone-anchored hearing systems 
(BAHS) and cochlear implants (CI), respectively, under the 
Oticon Medical umbrella. Our decision to continue to acquire 
distribution activities and our ongoing focus on innovation 
and end-user benefits are other examples of how we keep 
investing in future growth opportunities despite the fact that 
these activities have a margin-dilutive impact in the short to 
mid term. This is particularly true for BAHS and CI where the 
major part of our total investment in future growth is recog-
nised and expensed as research and development and market-
ing costs in the income statement as opposed to investments 
in fully established companies with dominant market positions 
and substantial market shares. 
To support the Group’s top-line growth and to ensure a con- 
tinuously high level of profitability, we have based our future 
global business model on a clear structure: The sales organ- 
isation focuses on sales, and shared services centres deliver 
all back-office services, such as IT, HR and Finance, as well as 
Production, Supply Chain and Quality. To that end, we estab- 
lished DGS in early 2013 as the new identity for the internal 
shared services organisation with a view to ensuring a dedi-

cated effort towards consolidating back-office functions across 
Group companies and optimising our global supply chain. The 
vision of DGS is to support the William Demant Group’s inter- 
national brands and businesses through superior shared ser- 
vices, cost efficiency and customer insight. Our DGS set-up and 
the philosophy behind it will ensure higher flexibility when we 
acquire new businesses and also facilitate the availability of 
more specialised competencies when needed.
Establishing DGS is a continuation of the efficiency efforts 
made in previous years and a natural part of our cost-
conscious corporate culture. Examples of our current and 
most recent DGS activities are many: Expanding our pro-
duction and distribution set-up in Poland; streamlining 
our global supply chain; offering ITE production and repair 
services to our European distribution companies; upgrading 
our global IT business infrastructure; expanding the number 
of local and regional DGS functions etc.
For the past two decades, basically all William Demant busi- 
nesses have gained significant market shares, first and fore- 
most achieved through innovation and effective execution and 
fuelled further by a selective acquisition strategy. Combined 
with continuous, high investments in research and develop-
ment and global distribution, our multi-brand strategy is the 
right medicine to counterbalance the impact of increasingly 
fierce competition in the traditional hearing instrument mar- 
ket. Admittedly, this part of the market has been rather chal- 
lenging in the last couple of years. Nevertheless, we have 
clearly demonstrated in the last few technology cycles that 
with dedicated focus on innovation, sound quality, speech 
understanding and customer orientation, it is indeed pos-
sible to outperform the market.
Another good example of our commitment to innovation and 
to meeting end-user needs is Oticon joining Apple’s Made for 
iPhone programme in spring 2014 with Oticon’s first Made for 
iPhone (MFi) connectivity solution for hearing instruments. In 
order to ensure that as many end-users as possible will be able 
to benefit from Oticon’s MFi solution, availability will not be 
restricted to specific price segments. In fact, Oticon’s MFi 
solution will be available for all existing and future users of 
Oticon’s ConnectLine instruments across the price spectrum, 
including an installed base of around two million current users 
of Oticon hearing instruments. Based on 2.4 GHz wireless 
technology, our new MFi solution enables iPhone remote 
control of Oticon’s ConnectLine hearing instruments, with- 
out compromising the audiological benefits and low power 
consumption that are indeed the hallmarks of Oticon’s hearing 
instruments. 
With the Group’s entry in 2013 into the market for fully implant-
able devices and given the fact that – in all aspects of hearing 
healthcare – we now already have either a strong market posi-
tion or a promising platform to grow from, we have obtained a 
very unique position in the market. In my view, this is a privi-
lege, so it is our obligation to make sure that we get the most 
out of it.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our 
dedicated and talented employees around the world for their 
performance and solid contribution to the results achieved in 
2013. The right employees and their various skills are essential 
in order for us to fulfil our high ambitions – both in 2014 and in 
the years to come.

Dear reader,
For William Demant, 2014 was off to a somewhat challenging 
start, especially in the US with unusually rough winter weather 
followed by market turmoil caused by a big box retailer whose 
customers got access to a premium hearing aid brand at very 
attractive prices. However, driven by a solid performance by  
the Group’s Hearing Devices business activity in the latter  
part of the year and based on significant growth delivered  
by Diagnostic Instruments, Hearing Implants and Sennheiser 
Communications, we succeeded in 2014 in generating 11% 
underlying growth in earnings per share (EPS), if we take a 
one-off adjustment and exchange rate headwind into account. 
Furthermore, we were capable of delivering no less than 28% 
growth in free cash flow, which for the first time in the history 
of the Company passed the DKK 1 billion mark.
I find this performance satisfactory in the light of a continued 
pressure on hearing industry wholesale prices driven by mix 
changes and fiercer competition and affecting the entire indus-
try. And even more so when we take our efforts to continuously 
improve the Group’s efficiency through the entire value chain 
into account. These significant efforts involve building and im-
plementing a new global ERP system across all Group entities, 
establishing shared services for our back-office functions, cen-
tralising our ITE production and repair services and creating  
a new global distribution centre in Poland. Furthermore, our 
cost base has been strained by our expansion into implanta-
bles, as significant Group resources are channelled into new 
R&D and distribution activities in order for us to be established 
as a viable and much bigger supplier of implantables, which is 
an attractive growth segment in the hearing healthcare market. 
All these major undertakings are meant to deliver value for the 
Group in the medium to long term, but will in the short term 
naturally weigh down the Group’s profitability.
In 2014, after a soft start to the year in our US core business,  
we launched a series of commercial initiatives that led to im-
proved unit sales momentum towards the end of the year. We 
were pleased to see how our hearing instrument wholesale 
business gained momentum in the US as the year progressed, 
with most of this growth generated in the independent channel. 
We thus regained the US market shares we lost at the begin-
ning of the year, which more than compensated for the declin-
ing average selling price witnessed not only by us, but also by 
the US hearing aid market in general. But just as importantly, 
the positive unit development seems to have continued into 
2015. All in all, I’m confident that spearheaded by Oticon, the 
Group’s hearing instrument businesses have benefitted from 
the turbulence in the US market, as our market position with 
the independent dispensers – by far the largest distribution 
segment in the US – was strengthened even further.
I’m also convinced that we are on the right track to deliver on 
our ambition to become one of the world’s strongest hearing 
healthcare companies. We have the broadest and deepest 
product offering, covering all aspects of hearing healthcare 
based on true innovation and delivered to customers and  
end-users through a multi-brand approach. Our entry into the 
cochlear implant market through the acquisition of Neurelec  
in 2013 was a major milestone in achieving this ambition. 
However, we still have a number of years ahead of us that will 
require further investments and costs in order for us to be able 
to build a strong position in the attractive and growing cochlear 
implant market.
Over time, we expect to harvest significant synergies from this 
unique position, especially in research and development, but 
also in manufacturing and global distribution and from cross-
selling between the three business activities: Hearing Devices, 
Diagnostic Instruments and Hearing Implants. Overall, we feel 
that we are very strongly positioned to meet our long-term  
strategic ambition.
The journey towards becoming a strong global hearing implant 
company will pick up speed in 2015, as we plan to launch the 
first complete Oticon Medical cochlear implant system under 
the Neuro name based on the Group’s proprietary technolo-
gical platforms – something we have already done in bone-
anchored hearing systems. The Neuro launch is a major under-
taking by the Group’s implant business and will require signi-
ficant resources – both human and monetary.
Our Group’s considerable launch activities in 2015 were kicked 
off with Oticon’s February introduction of the new Inium Sense 
platform and with the launch of new products across all styles, 
at all price points and in all markets. This comprehensive intro-
duction marks the biggest and broadest product launch ever 
undertaken by Oticon and is described further later in this 
report. By offering the most cosmetically attractive wireless 
hearing instruments with the lowest power consumption and 
the strongest audiological performance on the market, we are 
definitely entering 2015 with strengthened competitiveness.
So, moving into 2015 – backed by solid momentum created in 
the latter part of 2014 combined with comprehensive launch 
activities – I’m confident that the Group is strongly positioned 
to grow and take further market shares in 2015.
The number of Group employees has now exceeded 10,000 of 
which more than 85% are based outside Denmark. I would like 
to express my heartfelt gratitude 
to all our highly skilled employees 
for their commitment, dedication 
and effort – our employees are 
our most important asset.

... BROADEST AND DEEPEST PRODUCT OFFERING
COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF HEARING HEALTHCARE ...
4 THE YEAR AT A GLANCE
In 2014, consolidated revenue amounted to DKK 9.3 billion, 
corresponding to 6% growth in local currencies. Organic 
growth and acquisitions contributed by almost 4 and 3 per-
centage points, respectively, whereas exchange rates had a 
negative impact of 2 percentage points. All of our three busi-
ness activities – Hearing Devices, Diagnostic Instruments and 
Hearing Implants – realised organic revenue growth in 2014.
Earnings per share (EPS) were DKK 23.8, which is a rise of 5% 
on last year and within the most recently announced guidance 
range of 2-7%. When adjusted for negative exchange rates and 
a one-off loss on a US customer loan, underlying growth in EPS 
was 11%.
Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to DKK 1,761 million, or an 
increase of 1% compared with reported EBIT in 2013. If ad- 
justed for a negative exchange rate effect of DKK 50 million  
and the one-off loss on a customer loan of DKK 40 million,  
EBIT was DKK 1,851 million in 2014, or an increase of 7% com-
pared with reported EBIT in 2013. In 2014, our profit margin 
was 18.8%, corresponding to a fall of 0.6 percentage point 
compared with the reported profit margin in 2013. If adjusted 
for the negative exchange rate effect and the one-off loss, the 
profit margin was 19.6%, or an increase of 0.2 percentage 
point compared with the profit margin realised in 2013. 
Furthermore, the acquisition of distribution activities and 
Neurelec in 2013 had a dilutive effect on our full-year profit 
margin, and bearing this in mind, we find the development  
in our profit margin satisfactory.
In 2014, the global demand for hearing aids by end-users  
again proved to be stable. We estimate that global in 2014  
unit growth was 5-6%, exceeding our normal expectations of 
3-4% unit growth. 2014 was characterised by abnormal trends 
in the world’s two largest hearing aid wholesale markets, the 
US and Germany, and since these two markets combined re-
present approximately half the global market in terms of value, 
the year was in many ways unusual. In our judgement, the 
average selling price (ASP) on the hearing aid market declined 
by 4-5% in 2014, primarily due to changed market dynamics in 
the US, a new reimbursement system in Germany and generally 
intensified competition. In terms of value, the overall market 
growth rate was, in our estimation, slightly positive. 
Our core business – the development, manufacture and whole-
sale of hearing aids – realised an organic growth rate of 2% in 
2014. This growth was driven by a satisfactory unit growth rate 
of 8% that more than offsets the decline in the Group’s hearing 
aid wholesale ASP of more than 5%. This decline in our ASP 
was mainly due to product and country mix shifts as well as  
the already mentioned changed market dynamics in a few key 
markets, especially the US.
The addition of one manufacturer’s premium hearing aid brand 
to a big box retailer in the US dampened our own sales to this 
particular retailer up until late 2014 where it stabilised. In the 
first half of the year, these market changes led us to launch 
commercial initiatives in our core business in the US, resulting 
in improved sales momentum in the second half-year. Because 
of the solid growth achieved in the US, we have regained the 
market shares we lost at the beginning of the year. This posi-
tive unit sales momentum has continued into 2015, and we 
expect it to more than compensate for the declining ASP wit-
nessed not only by us, but also by the US hearing aid market  
in general. After a soft start to the year, our sales to Veterans 
Affairs (VA) in the US picked up towards the end of the year. A 
generally upgraded product offering has driven our improved 
importance in the important VA channel, causing our market 
share with VA to rise by a couple of percentage points in 2014.
Oticon’s strong position in hearing care will be further strength-
ened in 2015 due to the launch of the new Inium Sense plat-
form. The new platform is currently being launched in all styles, 
at all price points and in all markets and marks the biggest and 
broadest product launch ever undertaken by Oticon.
With Oticon Alta2, Nera2 and Ria2, we introduce a brand new 
generation of our most popular Performance families, including 
a new smaller and more discreet miniRITE style in all three fam-
ilies. Combined with the multiple, cosmetically attractive, wire-
less hearing instruments already launched in the second half 
of 2014, these substantial product introductions support the 
THE YEAR AT A GLANCE
5THE YEAR AT A GLANCE
good momentum gained by the Group in the latter part of 2014, 
and we are confident that the updated product portfolios will 
further strengthen our competitiveness in 2015.
Also Bernafon and Sonic have seen solid development driven 
by continuous launches by both brands.
In our Hearing Implants business activity, we are steadily  
working towards fulfilling our long-term ambition of becoming 
one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hearing implants. 
Reaching this ambition will of course take some years, but with 
important milestones already reached in 2013 and 2014 and 
with the activities planned for 2015, we have taken important 
steps towards realising this goal. 
In 2015, we will reach a major milestone with the launch of  
the first Oticon Medical cochlear implant (CI) system under  
the Neuro brand name. The Neuro system is the result of a  
very ambitious implant and sound processor project. New  
and very important implant features and also the integration  
of signal processing and audiology features from Oticon hear-
ing aids are key improvements, which will enable Oticon 
Medical to not only penetrate the very important markets in 
Northern Europe, but also to strengthen our competitive edge 
in France, Southern Europe, Canada and South America. Fur-
thermore, the Neuro system will enable Oticon Medical to start 
applying for an FDA clearance to launch CI activities in the US.
Based on the very positive reception of the Ponto Plus sound 
processor by the market and our good clinical data on the soft 
tissue preservation technique, total sales in bone-anchored 
hearing systems (BAHS) developed favourably in 2014. In 2015, 
we will launch a new surgery concept that will make the proce-
dure faster, even more cosmetically attractive and fully reversi-
ble. Towards the end of the year, we will launch a new implant 
for the Ponto system, which will enable faster loading and 
higher stability. In 2015, we will also launch the first Ponto  
app that will enable users to adjust their sound processor 
using an iPhone or an Android phone together with the 
ConnectLine Streamer.
In the period under review, organic revenue growth in our retail 
activities was in line with market growth in the markets where 
we operate. Especially Europe, but also Australia, contributed 
to this organic growth. Acquired growth exceeded organic 
growth. This trend can mainly be attributed to the full-year 
effect of acquisitions made in 2013. In 2014, we only made a 
small number of acquisitions as we mainly focused on improv-
ing the performance of our existing entities and consolidating 
the entities acquired, thereby improving profitability in the 
years to come.
Our Diagnostic Instruments business activity grew by a satis-
factory 11% in local currencies in 2014 of which 10 percentage 
points are attributable to organic growth. This organic growth 
was especially driven by satisfactory sales of balance equip-
ment and equipment for newborn hearing screening. The glob-
al market for diagnostic equipment is estimated to have grown 
by 5% in 2014, and Diagnostic Instruments has thus signifi-
cantly increased its market share. In 2015, we will focus on 
integrating and developing the companies acquired in recent 
years and on continuing to generate organic growth in our en-
tire Diagnostic Instruments business. We expect the multiple 
product introductions in 2014 and also the introductions 
planned for 2015 to support this growth trend.
In 2014, Sennheiser Communications, which is our joint  
venture with Sennheiser KG, realised a satisfactory 16%  
organic growth rate, thereby exceeding the market growth  
rate. As mentioned in our Annual Report 2013, sales in 2013 
were positively impacted by the one-off sale of Sennheiser 
Communications’ inventory to Sennheiser KG, which means 
that in 2014, underlying sales growth was even higher than 
realised sales growth.

2015 was a good year for the William Demant Group. Our core 
business delivered a very solid performance, particularly in  
the second half of the year when we grew organically by 8%.  
To me, this proves that we have regained momentum and that 
market share gains are indeed possible when bringing true 
innovation to the market in an efficient manner. On the back  
of several years of strong growth rates in our Diagnostic In- 
struments and Hearing Implants business activities, we saw, 
however, a temporary slowdown in 2015 caused by reduced 
sales to a few oil-dependent emerging markets. The turbulent 
conditions in Russia and Belarus significantly impacted our 
Diagnostic Instruments business, whereas we saw a satisfac-
tory growth rate outside these two markets. We successfully 
reached a major milestone in 2015 with the prelaunch of our 
new CI system, but sales were dampened in anticipation of  
the new system combined with a postponed tender in Algeria.  
I remain confident in the potential and the fundamental attrac-
tiveness of our implant business, which is destined to be an 
important growth driver in the years to come. I see short-term 
fluctuations as an inevitable part of the process of improving 
all our businesses and building the hearing healthcare com-
pany of the future.
For a number of years, William Demant has been on an excit-
ing journey from being a hearing aid company to becoming a 
global hearing healthcare company. On this journey, we have 
demonstrated our ability to transform new business segments 
and even greenfield-type of projects into global, market-lead-
ing and profitable businesses. Besides growing the global mar-
ket share of our hearing aid business from around 8% in the 
late 90s to our current share of almost a quarter of the market, 
we have at the same time succeeded in establishing ourselves 
as a global market leader in diagnostic hearing equipment. 
Starting from a very low 
market share, we have 
thus captured 40% of 
the market. Since 2009, 
we have furthermore 
managed to capture 
approximately one third 
of the bone-conduction 
market, basically start-
ing from scratch. Clear-
ly, this gave us the  
confidence to enter  
the cochlear implant market in 2013. As it takes longer to grow 
a business organically than to grow it through major acquisi-
tions, and as it has a dilutive effect on the Group’s margins  
in the short to medium term, we strongly believe that by enter-
ing the cochlear implant market, we build new capabilities in 
our Group, we expand the Group’s existing product range and 
we create the most value in the long term. Finally, we have ex-
panded our customer universe to also include direct sale to 
end-users through our own retail network.

A shared global operational infrastructure is a prerequisite  
for delivering on our ambitious goals, and we have for the  
past several years been dedicated to streamlining this infra-
structure. To that end, we have moved the volume production 
of hearing aids and diagnostic instruments to Poland where  
we have also established our new, global distribution centre. 
Also, we are in the process of further consolidating our multi-
ple, local, custom-
made ITE production 
and repair shops into 
regional hubs, thereby 
facilitating the swift 
delivery of custom-
made hearing aids 
directly to the cus-
tomer. In this process, 
we have identified the 
need for a new IT infra-
structure, including an 
ERP system to enable  
a seamless information 
and product flow in the 
entire value chain. This 
process will continue in the coming years with ERP roll-outs in 
both our wholesale and our retail businesses. Of course, such 
roll-outs require a lot in terms of investments, resources and 
time, but they are critical in order to support our continued 
top-line growth and to realise significant cost savings.
Let me just for a brief moment expand on our hearing health-
care journey where we have grown the Company significantly  
in terms of size. By way of example, the number of employees 
has almost doubled in the past five years. Such a large-scale 
transition and expansion of our Group has required us to re-
think our organisational set-up. To ensure sufficient manage-
ment competencies when we embark on the next phase of this 
journey, we extended the Executive Board by promoting Søren 
Nielsen to COO and employing René Schneider as CFO. We feel 
comfortable that with these appointments, we have created 
the right basis for growing all of our hearing healthcare busi-
nesses.
Based on William Demant technology, our first-ever cochlear 
implant system called Neuro has been further developed since 
the acquisition of Neurelec in 2013 and was prelaunched in a 
few markets in the latter part of 2015. This is indeed an impor-
tant milestone in our ambitious journey in the hearing implant 
field. Reactions by patients, surgeons and key opinion leaders 
have been extremely positive, and this gives me confidence 
that Neuro will help Oticon Medical reinforce its position in a 
number of markets. We are fully aware that the road to becom-
ing a strong, viable player in the hearing implant market will 
not be without challenges, just as we are humble about our  
relatively small position and the fact that at the moment, we 
have no access to key markets like the US and China. We are  
of course working hard to gain access in these – and other – 
important markets, but it takes time to diligently conduct trials 
and go through the regulatory processes. This, however, has 
not dampened our overall growth ambitions, and in both 2016 
and 2017, we are positioned to generate significant growth in  
a number of our key markets.   
I am truly proud of our upcoming introduction in 2016 of the 
world’s first dual-radio hearing aid, which is a landmark in 
itself and combines the audiological advantages of our new 
near field magnetic induction system for ear-to-ear communi-
cation and a 2.4 GHz system for streamer-free connectivity. 
This industry-first introduction scheduled for the end of the 
second quarter is not only a technical quantum leap that opens 
a world of opportunities, but just as important a completely 
new audiological platform that delivers new groundbreaking 
technology and unmatched end-user benefits. 
Against the backdrop of the sound momentum created in 2015 
combined with significant product launches by all business 
activities and the extension of our distribution platform in mul-
tiple markets, such as France after the successful acquisition 
of Audika, I am confident 
that having now entered 
a new year, our Group is 
in a very favourable po-
sition to deliver strong 
growth in both revenue 
and earnings in 2016. 
Delivering on such ambi-
tious goals requires a lot 
of hard work and dedica-
tion. I know that all em-
ployees worldwide are 
committed to contribut-
ing to these goals, so I 
would like to take this 
opportunity to thank  
our more than 10,000 
dedicated and talented 
employees around the 
world for their perfor-
mance and solid contribution to the results realised in 2015.  
I look forward to taking our Company to the next level in 2016 
where we will exceed the 2 billion kroner milestone in operat-
ing income for the first time in the history of our Company.

team spirit
It was great to meet up with 13 of our more sporty partners when Team Össur fever hit 
London in September. The world’s media converged on London's iconic Tower Bridge 
to face a roll call that included such athletes as Oscar Pistorius, April Holmes, Marlon 
Shirley and Jerome Singleton.  The line between disability and ability continued to be 
blurred when Oscar Pistorius made history by becoming the first amputee sprinter to 
compete in the IAAF World Track and Field Championships.

We are extremely proud of being in a position to help change the lives of our customers. 
We at Össur are reminded every day of the courageous and inspirational people that 
make our jobs look easy. What drives the design of our products is that our products 
matter to the people who use them to overcome hurdles in their every day lives. The 
scientific research and development emerging from our partnerships with research

CEO REPORT
2011 was the most momentous year in 
the short history of Etihad Airways.
Against a backdrop of the global 
financial crisis, regional instability, 
continued high oil prices and natural 
disasters, our milestone achievement 
of profitability ranks as one of the best 
performances of any airline in the 
world.
Our target in 2011 was to break 
even. Thanks to the dedication and 
commitment of the entire Etihad 
Airways family, we surpassed that goal.
We delivered earnings before interest 
and tax (EBIT) of US$137 million, on 
revenues up 36 per cent to US$4.1 
billion. We carried 8.3 million 
passengers, up 17 per cent on 2010, 
with an average seat factor of 75.8 per 
cent, nearly two percentage points 
higher than the previous year. All parts 
of the business contributed to our 
success. Cargo revenues were up 25 
per cent to US$651 million on tonnage 
up nearly 18 per cent. 
Safety remained our highest priority, 
and our focus on providing the best 
customer service continued – for 
example, leading the way with 
innovative developments such as our 
First Class Chefs. 
During the year we formed a new 
Guest Experience department to focus 
on the entire journey of our customers 
President and Chief Executive Officer’s report
like never before. We will continue to 
innovate in 2012 through investment 
in our product, on the ground and in 
the air.
The new benchmarks we have set 
in modern air travel have not gone 
unnoticed. We were proud to be 
awarded the title of World’s Leading 
Airline for the third year in succession, 
and we were also awarded Best First 
Class and Best First Class Catering by 
Skytrax.
We launched five new passenger 
destinations in 2011 – the Maldives, 
the Seychelles, Chengdu, Bangalore 
and Düsseldorf – while also investing 
in our 11 cargo-only cities. Already 
in 2012, we have launched flights to 
Tripoli, Shanghai and Nairobi, with 
Lagos and Basra to follow, and new 
services to Washington DC announced. 
In 2011, we increased the frequency 
of more than 13 routes and we will 
continue this approach, with daily 
frequencies our minimum target and 
double daily or more where demand 
allows. During 2011, we introduced 
seven new aircraft, boosting our fleet 
to 64, and in 2012 we expect to add 
another seven aircraft.
We published the first-ever 
Etihad Airways Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report in 2011, detailing 
our policies and activities to date 
in relation to our environmental, 
community and philanthropic 
activities. This will become an annual 
report, charting our progress towards 
delivering best-in-class performance in 
this area.
The 2011 results delivered the mandate 
set by our shareholder, the Government 
of Abu Dhabi, to be safe, profitable 
and create the best airline in the 
world, while fulfilling our role as a key 
enabler in the transformation of Abu 
Dhabi into a world-class trade and 
tourism centre. 
While impressive, these results are 
now consigned to the pages of history. 
Today’s achievements are no guarantee 
of future success and our focus is now 
on reaching greater heights.
Sustained profitability is our new 
challenge and one that requires a new 
mindset. In 2012 we have once again 
set new targets for strong growth, with 
a passenger traffic target of 10 million 
and a corresponding increase in profits.
We know it will not be easy – aviation 
is not an easy industry. In 2011, 
we contended with the terrible 
earthquake and tsunami in Japan, 
global economic uncertainty, regional 
instability in the Middle East and 
high oil prices, averaging US$110.83 
per barrel over the course of the 
year – all of which were outside our 
control. As always, we will expect the 
unexpected, and in 2012 be ready to 
react to the unforeseen events that will 
undoubtedly arise.
While many factors will remain 
outside our direct control, there is 
much we can influence and a key 
area in 2012 will be our controllable 
costs. Our record in this area to date 
is notable. Costs per available seat 
kilometre, excluding fuel, have fallen 
by 16 per cent over the last two years, 
representing annual savings of more 
than US$187 million. Ongoing cost 
control will continue to be a key 
feature of how we do business and 
more efficiencies have been identified 
for 2012 and beyond.
Alongside this, much work will take 
place to develop and strengthen our 
strategic partnerships and investments 
to deliver increasing returns. Our 
strategic partnership with Virgin 
Australia – which took root in 2011 
and is proving very successful – and 
partnership and investments with 
airberlin and Air Seychelles, will play 
a very important part in sustaining 
profitability.
Through airberlin, Germany’s second 
largest airline and the sixth largest 
in Europe, we have instant access 
to the largest European market of 
80 million people in the strongest 
economy in Europe. This adds 157 
destinations and gives us access to 
35 million new passengers. This deal 
will be our most important catalyst for 
growth in 2012 and will have a major 
impact on revenues, with an expected 
contribution of some US$50 million. 
These partnerships are game-changing 
moves. In 2012, partnerships and 
alliances are expected to produce 
just under US$500 million in annual 
revenues. This is a massive contribution 
to our business, which is why we 
will continue to expand and develop 
such partnerships, strengthening our 
relationship with our 35 codeshare 
partners and giving sensible thought 
to new opportunities that arise and 
are right for the business to extend our 
competitive offering for the benefit of 
our customers.
Internally, we will continue to re-
engineer our business, such as through 
our deal with Sabre Airline Solutions, 
the aviation computer technology 
provider, to introduce revolutionary 
change through cutting edge, 
integrated software systems across the 
company. 
Etihad Airways staff grew by 15 per 
cent in 2011, to more than 9,000 
people from 128 different nationalities. 
We continue to focus on the 
development of an Emirati workforce, 
which now represents 18 per cent of 
Head Office staff, in addition to more 
than 1,000 participating in cadet pilot, 
engineer, contact centre agent and 
graduate manager training programs.
Given the challenges faced by the industry, our combination of 
revenue growth and entry into profitability must be one of the best 
results of any airline in 2011.”
President and Chief Executive Officer, James Hogan
As always, continued success will be 
driven by our people and depend on 
collective and individual focus, energy, 
and commitment to our customers and 
each other. We will also continue to 
instil the values of respect, consistency 
and discipline throughout our 
workforce. 
The year ahead will be about 
navigating the challenges that come 
our way, while cementing our 
reputation as a successful global 
business, one that delivers increasing 
returns to its shareholder. 
Finally, I thank our shareholder, 
the Government of Abu Dhabi. The 
Government has set Etihad Airways 
ambitious targets and we embrace 
them, knowing that in all we do we 
can count on the strong support of our 
Chairman and the Board of Directors in 
the implementation of our strategy.
James Hogan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
ANNUAL REPORT 20126
Etihad Airways experienced strong 
growth in 2012, delivering a 200 per 
cent increase over 2011’s performance 
with a net profit of US$42 million.
In our ninth year of operations, 
in addition to organic expansion, 
we increased our strategic equity 
investments, added codeshare partners, 
and continued to improve productivity.
These are significant achievements, and 
further evidence of the success of our 
equity alliance model.
But our achievements are even more 
significant when viewed against a 
backdrop of global economic uncertainty 
and continued fragility in the airline 
industry. Against the odds, we have 
continued to excel.
We entered 2012 having recorded the 
first full-year profit in the history of the 
airline. Our aim was simple: to build 
on that platform and deliver sustainable 
profitability for our shareholder,  
the Abu Dhabi Government.
As in previous years, the critical factors 
in achieving this, and distinguishing 
Etihad Airways from the competition, 
would be the highest emphasis on safe 
and secure operations, outstanding 
customer service, and best-in-class 
products. 
The principal headlines clearly show 
that 2012 was a successful year for our 
now firmly established and globally 
recognised brand: we carried more than 
10 million passengers and delivered 
profitability for the second year in 
succession.
Our route network grew to 86 direct 
destinations, 70 per cent of them served 
daily. We became a skilled multi-national 
team of 10,656 people, more than 1,250 
of them UAE nationals. As the national 
airline of the United Arab Emirates,  
it is right and pleasing that Emirati staff 
now comprise the largest nationality 
group at Etihad Airways. Our 
comprehensive Emiratisation training 
programs also reach more than 600 
people.
We continued to receive praise for what 
we do and how we do it being named as 
the World’s Leading Airline for the fourth 
consecutive year.
We are grateful for the recognition we 
have received and value it. However, 
we place greater stock on our ongoing 
role as key partner and enabler to Abu 
Dhabi Plan 2030 – the blueprint for 
future development of the Emirate. Our 
role remains as important today as when 
our first flight took-off, and I am pleased 
to report that our economic contribution 
has been impressive.
We will continue our clearly defined 
three-pronged strategy with respect to 
growth: minority equity investments 
in other airlines; codeshares and 
partnerships; and our own organic 
growth.
We have a 40 per cent stake in Air 
Seychelles, a 29.21 per cent stake in 
airberlin, a 10 per cent stake in Virgin 
Australia Holdings and just under three 
per cent in Aer Lingus. The revenue 
contribution from airberlin alone 
surpassed our full-year estimate ahead 
of schedule during the third quarter 
of 2012. Elsewhere, Air Seychelles 
achieved its financial targets in 2012 
- a tremendous result in the first 12 
months of a five-year Etihad Airways’ 
management contract, and a dramatic 
turnaround in the airline’s fortunes after 
several years of heavy losses.
Our equity partners provide significant 
contributions to our business and 
not just in terms of the revenues they 
deliver. The agreements provide us with 
greater economies of scale, increased 
purchasing power and the ability to 
leverage synergies. We have enjoyed co-
operation on fleet orders, deliveries and 
management, as well as joint purchasing 
in areas ranging from fuel to insurance to 
in-flight catering and equipment. Shared 
maintenance programs, training and staff 
development are other areas on which 
we have collaborated. It’s about working 
smarter to deliver lower unit costs.
We will consider further equity 
investments if it’s the right opportunity, 
with the right partner, in the right market 
and at the right price. In doing so our 
equity model will continue to be about 
growth, not control.
We have 41 codeshare partners, 
delivering a combined network greater 
than any Middle East airline. A highlight 
of 2012 was the launch of a new 
strategic partnership with Air France-
KLM, the first phase of which is a wide-
ranging codeshare agreement in Europe, 
the Middle East, Asia and Australia.  
Etihad Airways’ organic growth saw 
six new routes launched in 2012 – 
Ahmedabad, Basra, Lagos, Nairobi, 
Tripoli and Shanghai. In 2013, we will 
add Washington DC, Amsterdam, Ho 
Chi Minh City and São Paulo as new 
destinations.
The wide segmentation of our business 
helped our continued profitable growth. 
Australia and our major Asian markets 
performed strongly. Our routes into 
China - Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu - 
delivered strongly, further boosted by the 
strong growth of connecting markets into 
Africa and our codeshare partnerships.
2012 saw Etihad Crystal Cargo rebranded 
as Etihad Cargo and its progression to a 
next-generation brand that challenges 
the conventions of the air-cargo industry. 
Etihad Cargo aims to be the best air 
cargo operator in the world, and most 
importantly, the partner of choice for 
the freight-forwarding and business 
community. Etihad Cargo continued to 
make a vital contribution to our business.
We developed our products in a range 
of ways – both logical and imaginative. 
For example, we launched inflight 
connectivity to keep pace with the 
demands of an increasingly digital 
world and announced a partnership 
with Abu Dhabi Organics Farm, the 
first internationally-certified farm of its 
kind in the UAE, to source fresh organic 
produce for our First Class dining. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
We delivered our second year of net profit, 
thanks to organic growth, our partnership 
and equity investment strategy, and our 
forensic approach to cost control.
2012 ANNUAL REPORT 9
2012 also saw the start of a 10-year 
billion dollar deal between Etihad 
Airways and Sabre Airline Solutions 
to provide a cutting-edge platform for 
future growth. The core part of this is 
the migration of our Passenger Services 
Systems to an innovative SabreSonic 
platform in February and March 2013. 
SabreSonic will support reservations 
and ticketing, airports, and e-commerce. 
It will streamline work processes, 
enhance the guest experience, provide 
opportunities for increased revenue 
and reduce technology costs. This is 
the biggest transformation that Etihad 
Airways will undergo in the next 10 
years.
We continue to invest in developing our 
infrastructure. Construction work on an 
extension to the flight simulator block 
in our Training Academy is underway. 
The new building will house six new 
flight simulators and is scheduled for 
completion late in 2013.
A new Head Office Operations Centre 
will house staff from our Technical, 
Flight Operations and Network 
Operations Centre teams, as well as a 
new Emergency Response Centre. Etihad 
Plaza will have an extended Medical 
Centre, uniform stores and retail outlets. 
There will also be a new Crew Briefing 
Centre.
As we continue to grow we do so with 
full awareness that 2013 will present 
a range of challenges that will be both 
predicted and unforeseen. We know, 
for instance, that fuel prices, our largest 
single operating cost, are likely to remain 
volatile. This also means that we are 
committed to controlling the costs that 
we can. Our performance in this area 
in 2012 shows we can be confident 
in our ability to do this. In 2012, an 
independent benchmarking study by 
aviation consultants, Seabury, showed 
that Etihad Airways is in the lowest 
cost quartile for costs per available seat 
kilometre (CASK), excluding fuel, when 
compared to major international full 
service airlines.
I would like to thank the Abu Dhabi 
Government for its continued and 
unwavering support. I thank the 
members of our Board, led by our 
Chairman His Highness Sheikh Hamed 
bin Zayed Al Nahyan. I thank our valued 
partners and suppliers in Abu Dhabi who 
work tirelessly alongside us to help us 
fulfill the Government’s vision for the 
safe and profitable development of the 
airline. Finally, I thank our staff for their 
tremendous contribution to our business 
and their efforts to deliver service that 
really does make a difference.
Aviation is a long game and airlines 
must have the structure and strategy to 
weather the issues and thrive. I am more 
than confident that, at Etihad Airways, 
we have the structure, strategy and, most 
importantly, the people to make that 
happen.

BNH Annual Report 2010   1
As the theme for this year’s annual report, we feature 
a few “walks of life” that form part of the Kingdom 
of Bahrain’s rich heritage: fishing, agriculture and   
trading of textiles and spices. Today, a small number 
of farmers, fishermen and merchants continue to adopt traditional 
methods of working, but these are increasingly threatened by the 
march of progress.
For thousands of years, agriculture was a mainstay of Bahrain’s 
economy. Flourishing date palm plantations and numerous small 
farms covered the northern part of the main island. These were 
watered by an innovative system of irrigation channels fed by an 
abundance of fresh water springs. Some farms exist today, providing 
local markets with fruits and vegetables, and other produce. However, 
salination of the water table and encroaching urbanization pose 
increasing threats to their future.
As an island state surrounded by the bountiful waters of the Gulf, 
Bahrain used to enjoy a vibrant fishing industry, with an abundant 
local supply of fish and crustaceans. Large fleets of fishing dhows 
were a common sight up and down the Persian Gulf. Some of these 
traditional dhows exist today, albeit powered by diesel engines. 
Trading of Textiles & Spices
Bahrain has a long history as a bustling entrepôt. Conveniently 
located at the centre of the old Great Trade Routes, it provided traders 
and sailors with a safe haven and convenient stopover point. Two 
famous routes – the Silk Road and the Spice Route – carried much 
sought-after spices and fabrics from China and India to Europe. This 
burgeoning trade supported the growth of small merchants, who set 
up shops and stalls in the local souqs of Manama and Muharraq. 
Some of these still e uture business viability of these local souqs and 
traditional merchants.     
Preserving the past for future generations
As Bahrain’s oldest insurance company, we take pride in our own 
heritage, and our enduring role in contributing to the prosperity 
and security of people and businesses across all walks of life. As a 
responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to supporting the 
local community and improving the quality of life for Bahraini citizens.
 This commitment also extends to preserving Bahrain’s rich heritage 
and traditional ways of life. We therefore actively support initiatives 
that seek to protect the environment, conserve energy, build 
sustainable communities, save historical architecture, and preserve 
local customs.

Fisherman
Sitra
I am a fisherman today because not 
only is it an additional source of 
income to my family but also because 
this profession and I are inseparable!  
I have practiced it for as long as  
I remember as my late uncle was a 
fisherman by profession and I used to 
join him in his fishing trips to assist. 
As years passed by I developed a 
great passion for fishing and learnt all 
about it; past the demise of my uncle 
- who trusted me with his business -  
I bought a 12 ft. boat, recruited an 
assistant and got new equipment to 
help me carry his legacy.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
2017 was a landmark in Bakkafrost’s history. The investment 
in the combined harvest and value added production facility 
in Glyvrar was finalized, and this concludes the merging of 
seven factories into one facility. Looking at the performance, 
2017 was also satisfactory. The operating EBIT for 2017 was 
DKK 1,378 million.
 
INVESTMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
All of Bakkafrost’s investments have the same goal - to pre-
pare the company for the future by reducing the biological 
risk and making Bakkafrost competitive. It must be stressed 
that Bakkafrost is competing internationally. Success in this 
competition means that more values can be created to the 
local community. We, who are responsible for the company, 
must endeavour to have an operation as effective and sus-
tainable as possible, while the politicians must aim to set com-
petitive framework, compared to foreign competition. If one 
of these objectives fails, we and the community will lose.
 
Great value creation is already taken place at Bakkafrost. 
Havsbrún transforms wild caught fish and offcuts into high 
quality and healthy fish feed, which makes Bakkafrost’s

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
SUSTAINABILITY
Bakkafrost’s core values specify an intent to act responsibly, 
this includes thinking long-term on economic, social and envi-
ronmental issues. Bakkafrost strives to be market leading in 
sustainable business. All employees are required to bear in 
mind the environmental effects, work-related activities have 
on nature and the environment and to apply environmentally 
friendly solutions to the extent reasonably possible. 
 
For the first time, Bakkafrost has published Bakkafrost’s 
Sustainability Report 2017. The report is prepared, using Oslo 
Børs Guidance on the Reporting Corporate Responsibility and 
will give valuable information on Bakkafrost’s strategy and 
action on sustainability.
 
REWARDING OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Based on the solid performance in 2017, the Board of Directors 
will propose a dividend of DKK 10.50 per share at the Annual 
General Meeting, which corresponds to a total dividend of 
DKK 513 million.
 
THANK YOU TO OUR EMPLOYEES
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express our 
appreciation to all Bakkafrost employees for the commitment 
and hard work in 2017.
salmon unique. At the brand new VAP factory in Glyvrar, 
salmon is created into tasty and healthy products ready for 
the consumers. With our unique product and our sales and 
marketing effort we have achieved premium prices.
By building the new factory in Glyvrar, we wanted to go even 
longer in value creation, and the plan is to use the “old” fac-
tory at Glyvrar for product development and research. A 
new salmon fishmeal and -oil factory will start operation in 
Havsbrún in 2018. By producing salmon fishmeal and -oil from 
guts, skin and offcuts of salmon into more valuable products, 
Bakkafrost pursues more value creation. The plan is to certify 
this production as human grade. By this, all parts of the salmon 
will be used and sold as healthy food.
 
It is most important for us as a company to continuously 
develop in all areas. Bakkafrost has probably the longest 
value chain in the salmon farming business. We produce 
healthy and tasty quality products to the global market, and 
we strive to have a sustainable and competitive production 
throughout the value chain.

2 BNH Annual Report 09
Being a concerned corporate citizen, Bahrain National Holding is a company 
committed to spreading the awareness towards environmental concerns and 
embedding the importance of social responsibility amongst society members; 
this was reflected in the company’s active participation in activities revolving 
around this message as well as its educational advertising campaigns and 
various collaterals including the Annual Calendar and Annual Report. 
Henceforth this Annual Report was designed with the same vision in mind and 
in-sync with the company’s approach last year, but surely enhanced; the sleeve 
of this Annual Report uses a uniquely form of paper made of palm fronds. The 
making of this paper is supervised by the Children & Mother Welfare Society 
which aims to train Bahraini girls who are unable to continue their education 
and create job opportunities for them through the use of palm tree fronds that 
are readily available in local & GCC environments. Additionally, the report 
itself was printed on environmental-friendly paper authorized and certified by 
the “Forest Stewardship Council - FSC" located in Germany; the council is 
responsible for the management and maintenance of forests in accordance to an 
internationally authorized system.

Vuonna 1996 perustettu Restamax Oyj on suomalainen 
ravintola-alan konserni, jolla oli vuonna 2013 yli 60  
seurustelu- ja ruokaravintolaa, kahvilaa sekä yökerhoa 
eri puolilla Suomea. Restamax teki historiaa marraskuussa  
2013 listautumalla Helsingin pörssiin ensimmäisenä  
suomalaisena ravintola-alan yhtiönä. 
Restamax Oyj:n vuosikertomus 2013 on julkaistu  
varsinaisessa yhtiökokouksessa 23.4.2014.

Vuosi 2013 oli Restamaxin kannalta sekä historial-
linen että menestyksekäs ja olenkin siihen erittäin 
tyytyväinen. Restamaxista tuli viime marraskuussa 
ensimmäinen suomalainen ravintola-alan pörssiyhtiö. 
Kasvustrategiaamme tukeva listautuminen ja siihen 
liittynyt osakeanti mahdollistavat investointeja, jotka 
tuovat meille kilpailuetua tulevaisuudessa. Merkittävä 
määrä näistä investoinneista toteutuu vuosien 2014 ja 
2015 aikana.
Toimintaympäristö vuonna 2013 oli varsin haas-
tava ravintola-alalla. Alan kokonaismyynti on viime 
vuosina kasvanut Suomessa keskimäärin 3-4 prosent-
tia, eli jonkin verran bruttokansantuotetta voimak-
kaammin. Alan viimevuotinen liikevaihdon kasvu oli 
1,4 prosenttia. Vaikka yleinen taloudellinen tilanne 
Suomessa jatkui epävakaana ja kustannusten nousu 
jatkui, niiden vaikutukset yhtiön tuotteiden ja palve-
luiden kysyntään olivat suhteellisen vähäiset. 
Yleistaloudellisesta tilanteesta huolimatta Restamax 
pystyi ylläpitämään erinomaisen kannattavuuden, 
joka on selkeästi toimialan keskimääräisen kannatta-
vuuden yläpuolella. Kasvuvauhtimme vuonna 2013 oli 
hieman edellisvuosia rauhallisempaa yhtiön keskit-
tyessä listautumishankkeeseen. Tästä syystä emme 
toteuttaneet merkittäviä uusia investointeja vuoden 
2013 aikana. 
Toimintaympäristöömme vaikuttaa myös vahvasti 
eduskunnassa käytävä keskustelu alkoholilainsää-
dännöstä. Ravintola-ala on merkittävä työllistäjä 
Suomessa. Hallituksen päätös olla korottamatta 
arvonlisäveroja on osoitus alan merkittävyyden 
tunnustamisesta, ja se antaakin uudenlaista toivoa 
ravintola-alan elpymiselle.
Vuosi 2014 tulee olemaan Restamaxille jälleen kasvun 
vuosi. Vuosi alkoikin vahvassa kasvusuhdanteessa, 
kun Restamax osti maaliskuussa Rengasravintolat-
konsernin. Yrityskaupan myötä 16 uutta ravintolaa 
siirtyi ravintolaportfolioomme. Kaupalla vahvistimme 
asemaamme mm. pääkaupunkiseudulla ja laajen-
simme toimintaamme uudelle markkina-alueelle 
Poriin. Tämän lisäksi Restamax perusti Hans Välimäen 
kanssa Gastromax Oy:n, johon kuuluu Helsingissä ja 
Tampereella sijaitsevat Midhill-ravintolat. Molem-
missa kaupungeissa aiotaan toteuttaa avauksia jo 
vuoden 2014 ensimmäisellä neljänneksellä.
Restamaxin toimintamallissa pyritään kehittämään 
erilaisia ravintolakonsepteja vastaamaan paikallista 
kysyntää. Laaja ravintolakonseptiportfolio mahdollis-
taa entistä suuremmat markkinaosuudet eri paikka-
kunnilla. Pyrkimyksenämme on kuitenkin ketjumai-
suuden välttäminen. Toimintamallin avulla pystymme 
paitsi tehostamaan toimintaamme paikallisesti, myös 
tarjoamaan kattavamman ravintolavalikoiman asiak-
kaillemme. Monipuolisesta tarjonnasta muodostuu 
elämysketju, johon kuuluvat kahvila-, ravintola- ja 
viihdepalvelut aina varhaisesta aamusta myöhäiseen 
yöhön asti.
Henkilökohtaisesti minua ilahduttaa se, että henkilö-
kuntamme oli aktiivisesti mukana yhtiön listautumis-
annissa. Tämä osoittaa, että Restamaxilla on vahvasti 
sitoutunut ravintolajohto ja henkilöstö. Nämä osaajat 
vapautuvat nyt vuoden 2013 listautumisprosessista 
toteuttamaan yhtiön kasvustrategiaa. Vuonna 2014 
aiommekin vahvistaa osaamistamme entisestään mm. 
palvelu- ja myyntikoulutusten avulla. Rengasravinto-
lat-kaupan myötä olemme saaneet toivottaa tervetul-
leiksi joukkoomme liudan uusia osaajia, joiden kanssa 
lähdemme yhdessä rakentamaan yhtiön tulevaisuutta. 
Ja sitä katsommekin varsin positiivisin mielin Suomen 
suurimpana osuuskuntatoiminnan ulkopuolisena 
ravintolayhtiönä.

usKomme pääsevämme lähelle vuodelle 
2015 aseTTamaamme 100 miljooNaN euroN 
liiKevaihToTavoiTeTTa jo vuodeN 2014 aiKaNa.
Restamaxin kasvutarina johtaa juurensa vuoteen 1996, 
jolloin aloimme rakentaa yhtä Suomen suurinta ravin-
tola-alan yritystä ja alan ensimmäistä pörssiyhtiötä. 
Vuoteen 2010 asti yritys toimi tulorahoituksen poh-
jalta. Tämän jälkeen saimme mukaan myös pääoma-
sijoittajia, ja kasvuvauhti alkoi kiihtyä. Viime vuosi 
oli käänteentekevä. Kannattavuudestamme oli vahvat 
näytöt ja yhtiön taustat olivat kunnossa, kasvusuunni-
telmamme olivat kunnianhimoiset, mutta realistiset. 
Aika oli kypsä pörssiin listautumiselle.
Vuoden 2013 pörssilistautuminen tuotti pääomaa 
kasvua varten 15,5 miljoonaa euroa. Raha ei ehtinyt 
kauan maata paikoillaan, sillä investoinnit aloitettiin 
välittömästi. Tammikuussa 2014 Restamax ja ravin-
tolayrittäjä Hans Välimäki perustivat Gastromax-yh-
teisyrityksen ja maaliskuussa toteutettiin 16 ravintolaa 
kattava Rengasravintolat-yrityskauppa.
Tavoitteenamme on ollut yhtiön historian alusta 
lähtien kasvattaa liiketoimintaa nopeasti ja rohke-
alla otteella. Tähtäimessä on ollut tarjota yksilöllisiä 
ravintolapalveluja erilaisille asiakkaille. Olemme 
oikealla tiellä. Nyt vuoden 2014 alussa konserniimme 
kuuluu yli 80 ravintolaa eri puolella Suomea; yöker-
hoja, ruoka- ja seurusteluravintoloita, pubeja sekä 
kahviloita. 
Amerikkalainen ketjumaailma ei meille sovellu, sillä 
markkinat Suomessa ovat pienet. Laajentuminen 
vaatii useita hyviä yksilöllisiä konsepteja, jotka ovat 
räätälöitävissä paikkakuntakohtaisesti. Asiakkaiden 
toiveet ja vaatimukset eri kaupungeissa ovat erilaiset, 
Jyväskylässä samanlainen ravintolakonsepti ei menes-
ty kuin Helsingissä. Ravintolamme toimivat lähes 40 
erilaisella konseptilla ja näenkin juuri konseptoinnissa 
monet menestymisen mahdollisuudet. 
Ravintola-ala on viime vuosina ollut vaikeassa 
asemassa. Valtion toimet, veronkorotukset ja Viron-
tuonti langettavat alalle varjonsa ja kilpailu on kovaa. 
Ihmiset käyvät ravintoloissa kuitenkin taloudellisesti 
heikompinakin aikoina, kun vain tarjonta on sopivaa. 
Hyvän ruoan ja juoman lisäksi ravintoloiden tulee olla 
kiinnostavia ja vetovoimaisia muullakin tavoin.  
Menestyjiä ovat ne, jotka kuuntelevat asiakasta.
Haasteista huolimatta Restamax uskoo säilyttävänsä 
alalla keskimääräistä vahvemman kannattavuutensa 
tulevanakin vuonna. Toimintamme on tällä hetkellä 
eteläiseen Suomeen painottunutta, mutta lähitu-
levaisuuden suunnitelmia pohjoisenkin varalle on 
tehty. Eteenpäin meitä ajaa yrittäjämäinen ketteryys 
ja taustavoimanamme toimii suuruuden ekonomia. 
Uskomme pääsevämme lähelle vuodelle 2015 asetta-
maamme 100 miljoonan euron liikevaihtotavoitetta jo 
vuoden 2014 aikana.
