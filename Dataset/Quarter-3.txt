Earnings  Earnings per share were SEK 0.91, representing an improvement of 72 percent  compared with the same period in 2006. The operating profit of SEK 74m has  relatively speaking increased more than earnings per share as a consequence of  acquisitions being paid for with newly issued shares. The operating profit for  business activities in Sweden rose by 131 percent compared with the same period in  2006. Investments in growth for the subsidiaries in the UK and Denmark have  burdened the operating margin, while the subsidiaries in Germany and Finland have  contributed positively to the Group's results.    The operating profit for a rolling twelve-month period (October 2006 – September  2007) was SEK 117m (64), representing an increase of 83 percent.    Sales  In Sweden, sales increased in the nine-month period by 14 percent compared with  the same period in 2006. Sales for the German operations rose by 42 percent  compared with same period last year. The equivalent rise in Finland was 34 percent.    In total, operations outside Sweden represent 30 percent of the Group's  consolidated sales. All non-Swedish subsidiaries are deemed to be able to achieve  good growth rates, and sales within the non-Swedish part of the Group are expected  to increase.    Consolidated sales for a rolling twelve-month period for the Group were SEK 1,342m  (977), representing an increase of 37 percent.

Capacity utilisation has been good and price levels have been stable during the  year. There is room to further increase capacity utilisation. Competition for the  recruitment of experienced consultants in the market continues to be strong, which  implies greater staff mobility within the sector. Acando has a significant need to  recruit consultants within many areas of expertise. High staff turnover is expensive  both in the form of recruitment costs and that a certain period of time is required to  cover newly recruited consultants. The Company's management focuses strongly on  attracting and retaining employees. These efforts gave results towards the end of  the quarter, with a net inflow of consultants. As part of the Company's endeavours to  meet clients' requirements and increase flexibility, a cooperation agreement was  entered into in the beginning of October with two sub-consultancy firms, KeyMan  and Dfind, with regard to IT and management consultant services.    Germany  In the second quarter, 16 SAP consultants were employed further to being taken  over from TietoEnator. These consultants contributed to sales and profitability in the  third quarter, including through the state-of-the-art expertise brought to the German  operations. One particularly large and strategically important project in the period is  the global implementation of Microsoft-CRM for the Kuoni travel agency, with 2,900  users, and which is being carried out together with Acando's Swedish operations.    All units in Germany (Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Bremen) have reported a  profit. The Group's subsidiary in Germany has been successful in recruiting and  retaining consultants.   INTERIM REPORT   1 January – 30 September 2007            ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (16)  www.acando.com    A provision of SEK 3.8 for a doubtful receivable related to a particular client with  financial problems was made at the end of the period. Without this provision, the  operating profit margin for Germany would have been 10.0 percent for the quarter.    Norway  On 28 September 2007, Acando AB acquired all shares of the Norwegian IT  company Abeo. Abeo employs 85 people with experience and knowledge within  strategy, project management, architecture, integration and systems development.  For 2007, Abeo is expected to generate sales of about SEK 120m with good  profitability. Abeo has offices in Oslo and Trondheim and is leader in the Norwegian  market for IT solutions within the healthcare sector. It also holds a strong position in  the public sector, as well as banking and finance. An initial amount of SEK 59m was  paid for Abeo, of which SEK 33m pertains to acquired liquid funds. An additional  purchase consideration may arise depending upon Abeo's profitability over the next  two years. This additional consideration is entirely profit-based, and is expected to  be approximately SEK 64m provided the Norwegian operations achieve good  profitability. The acquisition of Abeo has not affected the Group's results for the third  quarter.    Baltic Region and Eastern Europe (Webmedia)  Webmedia has experienced good demand in the Baltic Region with an increase in  sales to SEK 63m (40). The operating profit was SEK 6m (3), representing an  improvement of 100 percent.    In September, Acando increased its shareholding in the Webmedia Group by 11.6  percentage points. Acando now owns 38.6 percent of the company.    Other countries  The subsidiary in Finland has strongly contributed to the Group's results in the nine- month period, while the subsidiaries in Denmark and the UK – which are both in a  building-up phase with investment in the recruitment of consultants – had an  equivalent negative effect.    Finland: The Finnish operations – which are totally oriented towards the SAP sector  – are developing well with large and interesting projects. The challenge is to  increase growth through the recruitment of consultants.    United Kingdom: Business activities in the UK are oriented towards supporting large  Swedish customers who have operations in the UK, as well as to developing the  existing activities of IQ Consultancy Ltd (acquired in March) that are primarily  oriented towards document management. The strong expansion witnessed so far

OPERATIONAL TRENDS PER GEOGRAPHIC MARKET    Sweden  The turnover for the first nine months 2008 was SEK 754m, compared to the same period last  year SEK 700m, an increase of 8 percent. The operating profit for the first nine months 2008  was SEK 76m, compared to the same period last year SEK 58m, an improvement of 31  percent.    The turnover in Sweden increased during the third quarter with SEK 11m to SEK 213m.  The  operating profit increased during the same period with SEK 7m to SEK 22m, an increase of 47  percent. The operating margin was 10.4 percent (7.3).      The demand for consultancy services was strong in the first nine months and the price levels  have been stable. Major customers include AstraZeneca, Vattenfall, ABB and Stockholms Läns  Landsting.    Acando continues to need to recruit consultants within many areas of expertise. These needs  are satisfied to a certain degree through sub-consultants. Due to the high demand, there is  considerable competition for experienced consultants within the sector, which has led to a high  rate of inflow and outflow of employees. However, the turnover rate has been reduced during  the third quarter.      INTERIM REPORT             1 January – 30 September 2008            ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (14)  www.acando.com  Acando has won several awards for their cooperation with Microsoft, during the period Acando  won one within Business Intelligence (BI) with the solution ”Better care with Business  Intelligence”.

CEOs COMMENTS  The normally negative seasonal variation of the third quarter was reinforced by the current  economic situation. Even though there is still an uncertainty, we notice an increased dialogue  about new projects.     INTERIM REPORT             1 January – 30 September 2009              ACANDO AB (publ) 2 (19)  www.acando.com  Increased efficiency is still high on many of the customers’ agenda, but also projects to gain  competitive advantage and to take positions on the respective markets.  The decision-making processes for new assignments are in several cases continuing to be  long, which have had a negative effect on capacity utilization. In general, the countries where  we have smaller units have been affected to a greater extent. The same applies for the Swedish  units working with large assignments. An example is the SAP unit, where we continue to  redirect towards higher degree of specialization and packaged solutions to increase efficiency in  existing implementations.   The average price for our assignments continues to be stable. The work on achieving a  changed assignment mix with a greater proportion of project undertakings continues, which has  counteracted the pressure on price.  During the quarter, we have clarified our strategic aims. We are now increasing our focus on  packaged offerings and reuseable solutions, and on utilizing the entire skills spectrum within  Acando in undertaking-based projects.   Acando is continuously adapting to the current market conditions through more efficient work  methods and adaptation of the organization. In order to safeguard better collaboration between  regions and skills areas, Sweden is united under a common management, where Christer  Norrman has been appointed Sweden manager. At the same time, a group-wide support  function is being established, aimed at increasing administrative effectiveness.     Acando’s broad customer base and geographical presence strengthens the possibility to act in  an uncertain market environment and secures Acando’s position for future growth.    SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN SUMMARY    A number of important framework agreements have been entered into during the period, with  the two most significant being the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, covering Strategy &  Management and Finance, and Sandvik, covering Acando's entire range of services and  applicable to Sandvik's global operation.  Acando's offering of "CRM as a service" which was launched in Germany based on Microsoft  CRM has created great interest, and a number of customer agreements have been entered  into, within both the public and private sectors.  There is great interest among several of our customers to improve their management, based on  more qualified and integrated analytical information background materials. For this reason,  Acando has launched a solution suite for profitability analysis, ProfitModeler™. The solution,  which is in operation at a number of customers, is based on and closely integrated with  Microsoft products.   INTERIM REPORT             1 January – 30 September 2009              ACANDO AB (publ) 3 (19)  www.acando.com  An Application Management (AM) centre has been established in Trondheim as an integrated  part of our AM offering, but also as a part of the existing and new customer undertakings  relating to application management in Norway.  SIGNIFICANT EVENTS FURTHER TO THE END OF THE PERIOD  Acando Denmark A/S has signed an agreement for the purchase of all shares in the Danish  SAP consulting company March IT A/S. Through the acquisition Acando strengthens its position  on the important SAP market in Denmark. March IT has a staff of 29 senior consultants and a  leading position in mobile solutions and logistics.    The reserve of the second and the last, additional purchase price for Abeo AS (today’s Acando  AS in Norway) has been lowered with SEK 4m against goodwill per 30 September 2009 and  amounts to SEK 26m, which have been paid during October 2009.    Lotta Jarleryd has been appointed new CFO (Chief Financial Officer) for Acando, commencing  on the 18th of January 2010.    THE ACANDO GROUP SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS    Acando has a strong financial position with a good cash flow and high solvency (71 percent).

 INTERIM REPORT     January 1 – September 30, 2010   Price-sensitive information that has to be reported   to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (19)        INTERIM REPORT     JANUARY 1 – SEPTEMBER 30, 2010    Third quarter – July 1 – September 30, 2010   Net sales: SEK 318 m (293)   Operating profit: SEK 12 m (7)   Operating margin: 3.7 % (2.4 %)   Profit after tax: SEK 6 m (4*)   Earnings per share after dilution: SEK 0.07 (0.05*)  January 1 – September 30, 2010   Net sales: SEK 1,053 m (1,085)   Operating profit: SEK 46 m (46). Restructuring costs  of SEK 20 m were charged against earnings in the  preceding year.   Operating margin: 4.3 % (4.2 %)   Profit after tax: SEK 30 m (42*)   Earnings per share after dilution: SEK 0.39 (0.55*)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 71 m (134)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO    The market situation improved during the third quarter in several of our markets. Growth in net sales amounted to 12  percent in local currency and the operating profit improved. The result for the quarter was charged with costs of  approximately SEK 5 m attributable to estimated additional costs in three major customer projects and with  approximately SEK 2 m arising from management changes in Denmark. Our ongoing work on operational efficiency  continues with the aim of increasing the operating margin to a more satisfactory level.  Although Sweden is growing in line with strong market conditions, our expectations of improved profits have not  materialized in each competence area. I am happy to report that operations in Germany are developing positively after a  weak start to the year. The order book in Norway improved significantly in the third quarter and the Oslo office is still  reporting strong demand for strategic IT services.   Finland and the UK continue to deliver growth and high margins. Operations in Denmark continue to be weighed down by  a combination of low prices and an unsatisfactory utilization. The Managing Director of the Danish subsidiary left the  company in September and further changes in management were made at this time. The cost of these changes amounted  to approximately SEK 2 million for the quarter.  We are proud of being appointed a Subscription Partner of SAP and the first supplier in the Nordic market to sign a  Software as a Service agreement. Cloud based deliveries are one of our focus areas and we see favorable opportunities to  grow and take a leading position.   We continue to have a need for further recruitment and have been unable to grow the work force at the planned pace. In  the short-term, we are meeting demand by developing our subcontractor business. Recruitment efforts were intensified in  September and October.  *No tax expense was charged against earnings in 2009.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2010          ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (19)  www.acando.com  Market development    Demand was favorable in the third quarter, even after  taking into consideration the normal seasonal variations  in the form of lower activity levels in the summer  months, in those markets where Acando is strongest.  The number of new projects increased in Sweden and  demand returned to more normal levels in the markets in  Germany and Norway. The stronger demand was not  reflected in any increase in average prices, but pricing  remained stable. The overall assessment is that good  market conditions will continue for the remainder of  2010.  Customers and offering  Acando’s large customer base combined with a broad  portfolio of management consulting and IT services  provide healthy opportunities for growth in a favorable  market.       Several of our customers are conducting  a change  process whereby Acando’s experience and deep  competence in Enterprise Architecture provide unique  opportunities. One example is the project for Forsvarets  Logistikkorganisasjon in Norway, which continued during  the third quarter. The project is aimed at developing  reference architecture based on NATO’s Architecture  Framework and SOA principles. The agreement includes  processes for maintenance, further development and  documentation and education services. Several similar  assignments have been started within public and private  sectors. Acando continues to need qualified staff within  Strategic IT.     The number of inquiries regarding services for SAP and  Microsoft are increasing. The raised level of interest in  cloud based delivery models is particularly notable and is  evidenced in September by Acando signing its first  Software as a Service agreement (SaaS) in respect of an  automated invoicing service based on SAP.  Acando  thereby becomes the first SAP partner in the Nordic  market to sign a SaaS agreement and has been  designated a Subscription Partner by SAP.  Microsoft continues to be Acando’s fastest growing area  of technology, especially as regards solutions such as  Microsoft Dynamics and Sharepoint. Acando is now  expanding this offering to additional geographical  markets.     During the third quarter Acando also secured the  following larger orders:     In September 2010, G4S Cash Solutions selected  Acando and SharePoint 2010 to provide its new  customer portal, which will include functions for  case handling, ordering services and follow-up and  statistics.   Acando signed a three-year framework agreement  for management consultancy services with a global  industrial group in September 2010. The agreement  includes supply chain management, customer  relationship management and performance  management services.   Demand for Acando’s offerings in the lean area  continues to grow. During the third quarter, Acando  signed ten new agreements in the service sector.    Net sales and profit    July – September 2010  Net sales and operating profit for the third quarter of  2010 are presented in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for the third quarter amounted to  SEK 318 m (293), representing growth of 9 percent. All  countries report growth in local currencies, but negative  currency effects mainly related to the EUR affected the  total growth negatively by approximately SEK 10 m.

The operating margin rose to 3.7 percent (2.4).          Profit after tax amounted to SEK 6 m (4). Earnings per  share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.07 (0.05), an  increase of 40 percent. When making comparisons, it  should be noted that no tax expense was charged against  earnings in 2009.    January – September 2010  Net sales and operating profit for the period from  January to September 2010 are presented in the  following table:      *Operating profit for the first three quarters of 2009 included  restructuring costs of SEK 20 m.  Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2010  amounted to SEK 1,053 m (1,085). The net decline of SEK  32 m is attributable to negative currency effects mainly  relating to the EUR. However, organic growth in local  currencies was noted in Sweden, Finland and the UK.     Operating profit amounted to SEK 46 m (46),  corresponding to an operating margin of 4.3 percent  (4.2).      Profit after tax amounted to SEK 30 m (42).  Earnings  per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.39 (0.55),  down 29 percent. When making comparisons, it should  be noted that no tax expense was charged against  earnings in 2009.    The corporate tax recognized as an expense in the  income statement in the first nine months of 2010  comprised the sum of current tax costs for the period and  the net of reversed and capitalized tax assets. The Group  has unutilized loss carry forwards totaling SEK 415 m,  which are deemed possible to utilize over the coming  years and will thus have a positive effect on cash flow.     The Group recognized deferred tax in an amount of SEK  101 m, which is included as a financial asset in the  balance sheet. This asset will decrease in pace with  utilization of loss carry forwards.    Profit trend per quarter     Net sales and operating profit per quarter for the period  from July 2008 to September 2010 are shown in the  following diagram:     Operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs  of SEK 20 m.  The customary seasonal variations are reflected in the  diagram, with sales lowest in the third quarter.  Consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2010  showed growth of 9 percent compared to the same  period in 2009 and an operating margin that was 1.3  percentage points higher.

Sweden    In Sweden, Acando experienced favorable demand in all  competence areas during the third quarter. Increasing  activity in the market is being more rapidly converted  into assignments and utilization is healthy ahead of the  fourth quarter.      However, the operating margin did not develop as  expected within Management Consulting and IT  Solutions. Furthermore, demand continues to be weak in  the Malmö area.      The SAP competence area showed good utilization  although prices continue to be low. Strategic IT  developed very well, with several new assignments in  Enterprise Architecture and IT Effectiveness.  Management Consulting’s concept for providing Lean for  service companies continued to develop rapidly with  several new assignments in the private and public sector.    The graph below shows the development of net sales and  the operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period July 2008 through September 2010:      The operating profit in the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring  costs totaling SEK 20 m and costs totaling SEK 4 m in the second quarter  for isolated changes in personnel composition.    Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 amounted to SEK  170 m (159), corresponding to a growth of 7 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 10 m (6), up about 67 percent. The  operating margin increased by 2 percentage points to 5.8  percent (3.8). The operating profit for the quarter was  charged with a cost of approximately SEK 4 m  attributable to estimated additional costs in two major  customer projects.     In the first nine months of 2010, operating profit  increased by 26 percent compared with the same period  the preceding year and the operating margin rose to 6.5  percent (4.9).      Overall, operations in Sweden accounted for 53 percent  of the Group’s net sales during the third quarter of 2010,  which was in line with the corresponding period in the  preceding year. Examples of major customers in the  period included AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Swedish Match  and Volvo.            2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 170 159 10 6 5,8% 3,8% Germany 79 86 5 6 5,7% 7,0% Norway 32 28 -1 -3 -2,3% -10,7% Other countries 42 25 -2 -1 -5,9% -4,0% Group adjustments -5 -5 0 -1 - - Total 318 293 12 7 3,7% 2,4% July - September   2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden* 598 626 39 31 6,5% 4,9% Germany 235 276 8 13 3,3% 4,7% Norway 112 113 1 4 0,8% 3,5% Other countries 121 83 -1 -1 -1,2% -1,2% Group adjustments -13 -13 -1 -1 - - Total 1 053 1 085 46 46 4,3% 4,2% January - September 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Q3  2008 Q1  2009 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Net sales Operating margin SEK m  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2010          ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (19)  www.acando.com  Germany    Demand normalized in Germany during the third quarter.  Combined with intensified sales efforts, this resulted in  improved utilization. Demand is high for projects based  on Microsoft’s technologies.     Acando secured a number of new customers in the  quarter and the ambition of broadening the customer  base stands firm. Price levels continue to be lower than  previous year.     Overall, opportunities are good for continued earnings  improvement in the fourth quarter.    The graph below shows the trend of net sales and  operating margin per quarter for German operations  during the period from July 2008 through September  2010:    Net sales during the third quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 79 m (86), down 8 percent. However, measured in  the local currency, operations posted growth of 3  percent. Negative currency effects due to changes in the  exchange rate between EUR and SEK resulted in a  decline in total net sales.     Operating profit for the third quarter, including Group  costs, was SEK 5 m (6), with an operating margin of 5.7  percent (7.0).      Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, HanseNet and Vattenfall.    Norway    During the third quarter, the market situation improved  in Norway, though competition for assignments  remained high. Acando’s position as leading advisor  within strategic IT was further strengthened via several  new framework agreements in the public sector. The  initiatives with Microsoft Sharepoint and Dynamics are  progressing well with favorable utilization ahead of the  fourth quarter. The competence area, Java, had lower  utilization during the third quarter, but several new  resource assignments were obtained towards the end of  the quarter.    The graph below shows the trend of net sales and  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from July 2008 through September  2010:  Net sales during the third quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 32 m (28), corresponding to growth of 14 percent.  Equivalent growth is reflected when measured in local  currency.     Operating loss for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 1 m (3).     Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to  SEK 1 m (4). Profit was negatively affected by guarantee  commitments in a major customer project.

     INTERIM REPORT      January 1 –September 30, 2011    Price-sensitive information that has to be reported     to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (20)        INTERIM REPORT  JANUARY 1 – SEPTEMBER 30, 2011    Third quarter – July 1 – September 30, 2011   Net sales SEK 326 m (318)   Operating profit SEK 4 m (12). Excluding   previously communicated nonrecurring costs  attributable to the disposal of operations in   Denmark, operating profit totaled SEK 23 m (12).      Operating margin 1.4% (3.7%)   Loss after tax SEK 3 m (profit: 6)   Earnings per share after dilution were negative  in an amount of SEK 0.04 (positive: 0.07).   Earnings per share after dilution and excluding  nonrecurring costs attributable to the disposal of  operations in Denmark amounted to   SEK 0.22 (0.07).    January 1 – September 30, 2011   Net sales SEK 1,109 m (1,053)   Operating profit SEK 63 m (46). Excluding   previously communicated nonrecurring costs   attributable to the disposal of operations in   Denmark, operating profit totaled SEK 82 m (46).      Operating margin 5.7% (4.3%)   Profit after tax SEK 37 m (30)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.49  (0.39).   Earnings per share after dilution and excluding  nonrecurring costs attributable to the disposal  of operations in Denmark amounted to   SEK 0.75 (0.39).   Cash and cash equivalents were SEK 99 m (71).  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO    Our continued efforts to improve profitability and realign the assignment mix towards more deliveries in project form have  delivered results. Excluding nonrecurring costs attributable to the disposal of operations in Denmark as communicated earlier,  the operating margin has improved by 3.4 percentage points compared with the same period in 2010. Our major markets are  making a positive contribution to our margin trend. In Sweden and Germany scope exists for additional improvement in  margins, as the new employees that started in the autumn are phased into customer projects.    Demand remained stable during the quarter and we have seen no signs of an immediate slowdown. However, we have noted  that certain decision processes for major projects have become longer.    In October, we asked 100 of our major customers in Sweden how the current macroeconomic trend impacted their operations.  Half of those asked responded that they had either decided for or considered efficiency measures even though only one in ten  had been able to note any negative impact on demand. A majority, seven out of ten, say they are prioritizing the  implementation of efficiency programs and reprioritizing investment projects as the key measures, followed by hiring freezes  and reduced staffing levels.     Acando’s offering to our customers is well-placed to meet the need for enhanced business efficiency and business  development. Our three main offerings, Management Consulting, Enterprise Solutions and IT Consulting collaborate in the  endeavor to create measurable results in every customer assignment. We continue to recruit in all skills areas and geographic  markets. Through offering the market’s most interesting assignments in project form, we wish to attract and retain the best  employees.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (20)  www.acando.com  Significant events in the third quarter    In the past year, a number of measures were undertaken to  restructure Acando’s Danish consultancy operations to  realize satisfactory profitability. Despite these efforts,  operations have not developed as planned and  consequently reported a continued operating loss.     At the beginning of July 2011, Acando signed an  agreement with Q2con ApS regarding the takeover of  Acando’s consultancy operations in Denmark. Accordingly,  all 12 consultants left Acando to join Q2con.       Nonrecurring costs attributable to the disposal were  estimated to amount to approximately SEK 7 m, which was  charged against earnings in the third quarter. The  nonrecurring costs were primarily attributable to remaining  undertakings for premises and personnel. The disposal also  gave rise to goodwill impairment of SEK 12 m.  Market development    The third quarter was marked by the same high demand as  in the first six months of 2011. Toward the end of the  quarter, a degree of caution was noted as decision  processes for major projects took longer time. The  uncertainty of certain customers with regard to budget  conditions in 2012 also contributed to less clarity in relation  to utilization status than earlier in the year.    Prices have remained stable throughout the period with a  slight rising trend, particularly in Sweden.    Customers and offering  The nature of customer enquiries has shifted slightly  towards an increasing proportion of dialogues regarding  streamlining and rationalization projects. This was shown  by the strong demand for services to enhance Supply Chain  efficiency, in several cases, combined with business system  related changes or implementation.     Demand is also healthy for CRM solutions based on  Microsoft’s CRM platform. One example comprises  Evangelische Stiftung Alsterdorf in Germany, which  implemented the RelaFund CRM solution based on  Microsoft Dynamics with Acando’s support in August 2011.   In addition, the number of streamlining projects for  rationalizing and consolidating IT environments increased  in scope as did services regarding sourcing strategies and  architectural efficiency.     In summer 2011, Acando established a competence  center for testing operations in Germany. The center has  20 employees who combine industry experience with  expert skills in test methodology. This enables Acando to  provide testing services in the three largest geographic  markets, Sweden, Germany and Norway.

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2011  amounted to SEK 326 m (318), representing growth of  about 3 percent. The strengthening of the SEK, mainly in  relation to the EUR, had a negative impact on total growth  by approximately 1 percentage point.     Operating profit totaled SEK 4 m (12), which means an  operating margin of 1.4 percent (3.7).     Excluding nonrecurring costs arising from the disposal of  consultancy operations in Denmark of SEK 19 m, operating  profit amounted to SEK 23 m (12), which corresponds to an  operating margin of 7.1 percent (3.7).

A  positive trend was noted in terms of average prices.      In the Gothenburg region, Västerås and Stockholm,  profitability reported a positive trend during the quarter, in  parallel, several new employees took up their positions in  the latter part of the quarter which had a negative impact  on the utilization rate.      In Enterprise Solutions, that is SAP and Microsoft-based  business systems, demand was strong and is expected to  remain strong for the rest of the year. In IT Consulting, high  utilization figures and strong demand, primarily for  Strategic IT services focused on rationalization of IT  environments, were reported.      The graph below shows the trend in net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period July 2009 through September 2011:      Net sales for the third quarter of 2011 amounted to SEK 174  m (170), corresponding to growth of 2 percent. Growth was  primarily attributable to the increased volume of sub- contractors and slightly higher prices.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 13 m (10), up 31 percent. The operating  margin rose 1.6 percentage points to 7.4 percent (5.8). The  increase in profit was primarily attributable to higher  average prices, improved project profitability and  continued efforts with the cost structure.     Overall, operations in Sweden generated 53 percent (53)  of the Group’s net sales during the third quarter of 2011.      Examples of major customers in the period were  AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Volvo and Stockholm County  Council.        2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 174 170 13 10 7,4% 5,8% Germany 81 79 7 5 8,5% 5,7% Norway 39 32 1 -1 2,1% -2,3% Other countries 35 42 -16 -2 -45,1% -5,9% Group adjustments -3 -5 -1 0 - - Total 326 318 4 12 1,4% 3,7% July - September   2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 618 598 56 39 9,0% 6,8% Germany 237 235 14 8 6,1% 2,0% Norway 137 112 8 1 5,6% 2,0% Other countries 127 121 -15 -1 -11,6% 1,3% Group adjustments -10 -13 0 -1 - - Total 1 109 1 053 63 46 5,7% 4,3% January - September 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Q3  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (20)  www.acando.com  Germany    During the third quarter, the average project duration  decreased slightly compared with the start of the year.  Prices remained stable.     Demand for CRM solutions and portal projects remained  strong, which translates into a healthy utilization rate in  these areas.      The customer base was widened further and the relative  dependency on a few major customers was thus reduced  during the quarter.    The following graph shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for operations in Germany  during the period July 2009 through September 2011:    Net sales in Germany totaled SEK 81 m (79), an increase of  2 percent. However, the SEK strengthened against the EUR  and in local currency, the operation reported growth of  about 5 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  strengthened to SEK 7 m (5). The operating margin  increased by 2.8 percentage points to 8.5 percent (5.7). The  increase in profitability was primarily attributable to  increased sales volumes and a maintained cost structure.     Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, Volkswagen, Vattenfall, HSH Nordbank, and  comdirect bank AG.    Norway    The level of demand is unchanged in Norway with healthy  utilization rates in all skills areas.      A number of key frame agreements were extended in the  public sector, which constitutes a key prerequisite for  continued growth.     Demand is healthy for Acando’s skills in Microsoft-based  solutions such as CRM and Sharepoint, which provides  possibilities for increasing the customer base in the private  sector.    The graph below shows the trend in net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from July 2009 through September 2011:  Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 totaled SEK 39 m (32),  corresponding to growth of approximately 23 percent. In  local currency, growth amounted to approximately 21  percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  improved to SEK 1 m (loss: 1) and the margin rose to 2.1  percent (negative: 2.3), which was attributable to a higher  degree of utilization and improved project profitability.     Examples of major customers during the period were  Norway's National Police Computing and Material Service  (PDMT), NAV and DnB Nor Bank (Vital).      0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 14,0% 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Q3  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m -15,0% -10,0% -5,0% 0,0% 5,0% 10,0% 15,0% 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Q3  2009 Q1  2010 Q3  2010 Q1  2011 Q3  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m

The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not  before the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern  Faroese town that became the cultural and commercial centre for the Northern  Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksvik is located between two inlets  lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a  modern fishing fleet.  With the opening of the sub sea tunnel, the  Norðoyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksvík is physically linked with the mainland of  the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports.    SUMMARY OF Q3 2012   MARKETS AND SALES   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   SEGMENT INFORMATION   GROUP FINANCIALS   INVESTMENTS   OUTLOOK  Page 4 BAKKAFROST / Q3 PRESENTATION 2012  BAKKAFROST   – THE LARGEST FISH FARMING COMPANY IN THE FAROE ISLANDS  ~1 10 km      Largest salmon farming company in the Faroe Islands   ~71% of harvest volumes (Q3 2012)    50% of farming licenses       Harvested  9,730 tgw in Q3 2012 (9,243 tgw in Q3 2011)   Feed sale of 30,290 tonnes in Q3 2012 (30,404 tonnes in Q3 2011*)     Revenues of DKK 457 million in Q3 2012 (DKK 369 million in Q3 2011)   Operational EBIT of DKK 86 million in Q3 2012 (DKK 70 million in Q3 2011)     Positive results from all segments    *) Including internal sale of 21,093 tonnes in Q3 2012 ( 22,228 tonnes in Q3 2011).     Page 5 BAKKAFROST / Q3 PRESENTATION 2012  SUMMARY OF Q3 2012   Markets   Supply of Atlantic Salmon increased by ~ 21% in Q3 2012 compared to Q3 2011   Utilised market situation by differentiating sale to different regions    Operational key figures   Improved operational EBIT by 23% from DKK 70.0 million in Q3 2011 to 86.2 million in Q3 2012   Combined Farming/VAP EBIT/kg of NOK 8.0 (Q3 2011: NOK 6.1)   Farming EBIT/kg NOK 7.7 (Q3 2011: NOK 2.3)   VAP EBIT/kg NOK 0.9 (Q3 2011: NOK 13.6)  Operational development   Running on close to full capacity   Overall good operational performance   Improvement on efficiency still in process  Business development   Sold 51% in Faroe Farming, now considered as an associated company

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – September 30, 2013     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Financial Supervisory Authority            1 (24)        INTERIM REPORT    Third quarter, July 1 - September 30, 2013   Net sales SEK 296 m (321)   Operating profit SEK 3 m (18)     Operating margin 1.0% (5.5%)   Profit after tax SEK 2 m (12)   Earnings per share SEK 0.03 (0.17)      Accumulated, January 1 – September 30, 2013   Net sales SEK 1,033m (1,137)   Operating profit SEK 32 m (81)     Operating margin 3.1% (7.1%)   Profit after tax SEK 24 m (58)   Earnings per share SEK 0.34 (0.80)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 81 m (75)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The uncertain market situation meant continued sluggishness during the summer regarding new project starts and, in  addition, a propensity to completely "shut down" activities during the holiday period. In combination, this led to a lower  utilization rate over the summer months and a slower than expected improvement in September. The dialogs signaling a  recovery in the third quarter materialized later than expected and the notified projects and assignments did not commence  until the latter end of the quarter. Naturally, we are less than satisfied with the third-quarter financial performance but we are  still convinced that the measures we have taken on an ongoing basis will deliver an impact over the remainder of the year. The  quarter’s margins and earnings are in line with the preceding quarter after adjustments for nonrecurring costs linked to the  acquisition of e-vita and some restructuring measures.  During the quarter, we won a framework agreement with the Norwegian Tax Administration, which means that we now have  framework agreements in all the major IT procuring government administrations. Our position as market leader in Strategic IT  and Architecture has thus been further confirmed. As part of fully leveraging our framework agreement position with regard to  more technical services, and to take a clearer position on packaged solutions for the Internet, portals and integration, we  acquired Norway’s leading Oracle consulting company, e-vita AS, in the third quarter. e-vita combined with Acando’s own  consultancy operations in the Java area provides favorable prerequisites for continued growth.  In Sweden, we are experiencing an upswing in the market with an improved order situation and more new projects and  assignments, primarily in the Business Systems and Strategic IT areas. Several of these are starting in the fourth quarter and  provide better preconditions for the coming period. These assignments mean a need for recruitment with inflows in the first  quarter of next year.   The German market is characterized by continued uncertainty and increasing competition for assignments. This is clearest in  Northern Germany while operations in the south of Germany continue to trend favorably, particularly in Frankfurt and  Stuttgart. We are now seeing increasingly clear effects from the decline in volume at one of our largest customers and, during  the quarter, took measures to restructure and downsize operations in Hamburg and Düsseldorf, particularly in the SAP area.  Moving forward, our focus is on continued expansion at existing customers and, again, recruitment in skills areas with  healthier demand such as Management Consulting, Java and Microsoft. In our assessment, the German market and our  position there remains challenging.  The IT industry analyst Radar argues in IT Strategic Direction 2020 that the future belongs to those consulting companies that  best understand that operations and IT must cooperate proactively. Our business consultants understand the opportunities  and limitations of IT and our IT consultants always start from the basis of business benefit. This understanding of the whole  picture is part of our consultants’ DNA and, accordingly, I am confident that we will continue to create value for our customers  and thereby value for our owners. We anticipate improved conditions in several markets ahead of the fourth quarter. We   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (24)  www.acando.com  expect these improvements to have an effect in the fourth quarter, although not quite in line with the fourth quarter of 2012.  We have a strong balance sheet and are focused on maintaining a healthy cash flow.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (24)  www.acando.com  Significant events        Third quarter, 2013  In the third quarter, Acando expanded operations in Norway through the acquisition of the Oslo-based consulting company e- vita AS, which has more than 60 employees. e-vita AS provides IT solutions for optimizing business processes and, in Norway,  is market leader in portals and process solutions using Oracle technology. Acando has acquired all of the shares in e-vita AS  with the transfer of ownership taking place on October 1, 2013 and this is expected to positively impact Acando’s earnings per  share as early as from the fourth quarter. The purchase consideration less net cash at the takeover date is estimated at about  NOK 33 m and was primarily funded through acquisition financing, which will impact cash flow in the fourth quarter.    In the third quarter, Acando signed a framework agreement with Region Västra Götaland for services in the Strategy and  Management area. The agreement applies from October 1, 2013 until September 30, 2015, with a possibility to extend by 24  months.     During the quarter, Acando launched a Mobile Client app for Microsoft Dynamics CRM in Germany. The solution widens the  product portfolio of mobile CRM clients and is based on the latest version of Windows. CRM data is thus made accessible for  mobile units where customer-specific add-ons can also be integrated.    In Norway, Acando signed a framework agreement with the Norwegian Tax Administration for architecture and solution  definitions as well as integration and modeling in the third quarter,. This further strengthened Acando’s position in the public  sector with focus on advisory services.        Significant events after the end of the period  Since the end of the period, Acando has signed agreements with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency to support the agency’s  extensive investment in simplifying the sickness benefit process together with Transformator Design.    Acando also won the assignment to upgrade Moelven Töreboda’s Microsoft Dynamics AX business system from version 4.0 to  the 2012 version.            INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (24)  www.acando.com  Business activities        Market development  The uncertainty that characterized the Group’s markets in the first half of the year declined slightly in the third quarter. A  recovery was noted, primarily in the Nordic markets, resulting in increased orders in the Swedish market and continued  healthy public sector demand in Norway. Exactly how the market will perform in Europe remains uncertain and a degree of  uncertainty exists about the balance between supply and demand in the Finnish market.        Customers and offering  Demand remained extremely favorable for Supply Chain Management, which is part of Management Consulting. To a certain  extent, this was driven by Acando’s successes in the SAP area and integrated working methods between these skills areas. In  other areas of Management Consulting, increased levels of activity were noted but projects are short and structured in several  independent steps.    Strong demand continues for Strategic IT in all of Acando’s markets. Continued healthy demand in Norway and additional  assignments and extended assignments with customers in Sweden mean a high utilization rate and a substantial need for  recruitment.    Several minor supplementary assignments and a few larger project call-off orders indicate an improved market for SAP.  Projects that stood still in the first half of the year are again active. A clear increase in demand has also been noted in the  Microsoft-based business systems area.     The market for IT-related services is still characterized by increased competition for expert services. Acando’s focus is  increasingly moving towards solutions based on commercial platforms, such as the iKnowbase portal framework developed by  the acquired company, e-vita, the proprietary Acando Collaboration Platform based on Microsoft technology and an increased  focus on packaging Microsoft’s entire offering. This change is accelerating and Acando has excellent prerequisites for  engendering trust among clients through clear responsibility for the entire delivery, from business analysis to rapid  implementation.        INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (24)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Third quarter July – September 2013  Net sales and operating profit for the third quarter 2013 are shown in the table below:      Consolidated net sales for the third quarter amounted to SEK 296 m (321). Local growth excluding currency effects declined  6.9 percent year-on-year.    Operating profit was SEK 3.0 m (17.6), corresponding to an operating margin of 1.0 percent (5.5). Earnings were impacted by  the weak start to the quarter, primarily in Sweden and Germany, with low utilization rates as a consequence. During the  quarter, integration and restructuring costs that arose in conjunction with the acquisition in Norway negatively impacted  earnings by close to NOK 2 m. Consolidated profit after tax was SEK 2 m (12). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to  SEK 0.03 (0.17).        Accumulated, January – September 2013  Net sales and operating profit for January 1 to September 30, 2013, are shown in the table below:      Consolidated net sales for the first three quarters totaled SEK 1,033 m (1,137).

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – September 30, 2014     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (24)        INTERIM REPORT    THIRD QUARTER, JULY 1 – SEPTEMBER 30, 2014   Net sales of SEK 447 m (296)   Operating profit before nonrecurring items was  SEK 27 m (3), corresponding to an operating  margin of 6.1% (1.0)     The operating loss after nonrecurring items was  SEK 25 m (profit: 3)     The loss after tax was SEK 22 m (profit: 2)   Earnings per share were negative in an amount of  SEK 0.24 (positive: 0.03)  ACCUMULATED, JANUARY 1 – SEPTEMBER 30, 2014   Net sales of SEK 1,236 m (1,033)   Operating profit before nonrecurring items was  SEK 67 m (32), corresponding to an operating  margin of 5.4% (3.1)     The operating profit after nonrecurring items  was SEK 8 m (32)     Profit after tax was SEK 4 m (24)   Earnings per share were SEK 0.05 (0.34)   Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 41 m (81)  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The last quarter was one of the most exciting in Acando’s history. We have worked zealously with the integration of Connecta  into Acando and I am pleased to note that we have received a positive response from our shared customers and succeeded in  creating new customer dialogs that have, already, resulted in winning projects that neither Connecta nor Acando could have  done on their own. Our combined strength in the areas of Management Consulting, Strategic IT, Business Systems, both SAP  and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as a completely new opportunity to assume responsibility for customers’ digital transformation,  from strategy to solution development and implementation, creates entirely new possibilities. Our aim of becoming northern  Europe’s leading consulting company is within reach.  During the quarter, we established a new integrated and shared organization driven by a customer and delivery-focused  integration process, and set high, shared goals moving forward. As part of this, we have implemented our planned efficiency  and structural measures, which generate annualized savings of SEK 46 m compared with the 25 million previously estimated. In  addition, we have identified further potential for enhancing efficiency and will continue efforts to realize these in the fourth  quarter. I am impressed by how our consultants have already taken the initiative of offering our customers new skills and  possibilities together with new colleagues.   The merger has strengthened our position as a Microsoft partner, which can be seen not only in the many interesting ongoing  procurements in which we are participating but also in the fact that Acando was chosen as Dynamics AX Partner of the Year. We  also won the implementation partner assignment from Moelven. We will continue to capitalize on our position in Sweden, and  our position using Sweden as a base for expansion and acceleration in our other countries. We have already split the offering  between Norway and Sweden and are currently further strengthening this through closer integration of our operations as well  as through supplementing the offering with additional infrastructure and cloud-based services in both Norway and Sweden.  Similarly, we have initiated an establishment of Microsoft-based solution deliveries in Finland based on our position in Sweden.  We are continuing to drive our change efforts to accelerate our journey toward improved profitability. In brief, this means  ensuring that cost synergies are realized, increasing the structural utilization rate through a higher share of large assignments  and administration assignments, improving the cost mix through an increased proportion of offshore and junior consultants, as  well as higher prices through packaging and solution-based sales.  We have now established the foundations for the next step in our journey. The energy that is being generated now that Sweden’s  best consultants are meeting and being challenged in ongoing and new assignments is our strength. The market for our services  is characterized by ever larger projects with rising requirements for both operational and technological insight thus raising  requirements for us to be sensitive in driving and accelerating changes jointly with our customers. Access to new technology is  generating new solution potential and completely new opportunities in business modeling and process development. We are  uniquely positioned to meet these opportunities.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (24)  www.acando.com  Significant events      Third quarter, 2014  On July 10, Acando acquired 90.3 percent of the shares in Connecta AB and, on July 23, a further 2.8 percent was acquired. The  objective of the acquisition is to create the leading consulting company based in the Nordic region. The merger of Connecta and  Acando is estimated to unlock substantial market potential and create a key force in the Nordic consulting market in parallel  with creating attractive values for both companies’ customers, employees and shareholders.     The merged units are expected to assume a defined position in Sweden and, from that position, be able to accelerate growth in  Sweden and in the geographies outside Sweden where Acando already operates. During the quarter, work started on integrating  the operations. As part of restructuring the Group, an expense of SEK 52 m was recognized in the third quarter, the management  estimate that this will generate annual savings totaling about SEK 46 m. The restructuring costs pertain primarily to termination  costs for former management and administrative personnel at Connecta as well as costs for co-locating operations.    In the third quarter, Acando signed a framework agreement with Moelven Industrier regarding Microsoft Dynamics  implementation and administration services for the Moelven group companies. Acando won the assignment due to its high level  of skills in enterprise resource planning (ERP) assignments, strong focus on processes and its ability to support Moelven with  local resources in both Sweden and Norway.      Significant events after the end of the period    Microsoft chose Acando as Dynamics AX Partner of the Year on the grounds that the company recorded outstanding growth  and posted fantastic growth for AX license business as well as its delivery capacity through a clear sector focus and strong  emphasis on new sales. In addition, Acando has successfully packaged Dynamics with Microsoft Surface, which has become a  source of inspiration for other partners.          INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (24)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Market development  Demand in the third quarter was in line with the first six months of 2014, though with geographic variations.  I Sweden, Norway  and Germany, demand continued at normal levels even if a certain degree of caution was noted regarding larger investments.  The trend in Germany is less reliable, while Sweden and Norway are assessed as maintaining the same level of demand in the  fourth quarter as in the first three quarters. The market in Finland shows unchanged restraint and all inquiries are characterized  by intense competition.      Long-term demand remained favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital transformation and completely  new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become crucial to create clear links between  strategy, implementation and technology.      Customers and offering  Demand in the industrial sector and utilities continued unchanged with a focus on streamlining and cost efficiency, while retail,  Telecommunications, Information Technology, new Media and Entertainment (TIME) and the public sector posted increased  demand with a focus on digital interaction.  Several larger streamlining and modernization programs were noted in the banking,  finance and insurance industries    Demand for SAP and MS Dynamics remain favorable, in terms of new implementations, upgrades and continued expansion of  application.    Integration, cloud-based solutions and component-based architecture are driving an increasing need for control and  management of more open IT architectures. Demand is substantial in these areas. An increasing number of sectors are  becoming receptive to clear dialog about digital transformation. The need for suppliers who can articulate strategy and who  have the capacity to implement it is growing.        INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (24)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Third quarter July – September 2014  Net sales and operating profit for the third quarter of 2014 are shown in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 447 m (296). Connecta’s figures for two of the three months in the third  quarter are included in the above figures, since its operations were consolidated into the Acando Group from August 1.    Operating profit was SEK 27 m (3), corresponding to an operating margin of 6.1 percent (1.0) before nonrecurring items.  Nonrecurring items include costs totaling SEK 52.2 m connected to the acquisition of Connecta, more details are available in  Note 5 on page 22. Consolidated loss after tax was SEK 22 m (2). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to negative SEK  0.24 (positive: 0.03).      Accumulated, January – September 2014  Net sales and operating profit for the January to September 2014 period are shown in the table below:    Consolidated net sales amounted to SEK 1,236 m (1,033), with growth of 20 percent compared with the year-earlier period.   Operating profit was SEK 66 m (32) before nonrecurring items, corresponding to an operating margin of 5.4 percent (3.1).  Nonrecurring items include costs totaling SEK 54.5 m connected to the acquisition of Connecta, as well as restructuring costs  of SEK 4.4 m in Norway. The measures are expected to generate annualized savings of about SEK 45 m in Sweden and, in  Norway, the annualized savings are estimated at about SEK 8 m.   Consolidated profit after tax was SEK 4 m (24). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.05 (0.34).    2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 SEK m Net              sales Net              sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 280.5 153.4 20.4 4.4 7.3% 2.9% Germany 70.2 69.9 4.8 2.2 6.9% 3.2% Norway 63.3 40.8 4.9 0.2 7.7% 0.5% Other countries 38.0 34.5 0.9 0.7 2.3% 2.1% Group adjustments -4.6 -2.5 -4.1 -4.5 - - Total operational 447.4 296.0 26.8 3.0 6.1% 1.0% Items affecting comparabi l i ty - - -52.2 - - - Total 447.4 296.0 -25.4 3.0 neg. 1.0% July- September 62%16% 14% 8% Net sales Sweden Germany Norway Other countries   2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 SEK m Net              sales Net              sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 699.5 558.3 54.3 26.4 7.8% 4.7% Germany 212.4 214.3 11.9 5.2 5.6% 2.4% Norway 216.6 150.1 10.9 5.6 5.0% 3.7% Other countries 119.1 117.8 3.4 7.0 2.8% 6.0% Group adjustments -11.4 -7.6 -14.0 -12.0 - - Total operational 1 236.3 1 032.9 66.4 32.3 5.4% 3.1% Items affecting comparabi l i ty - - -58.9 - - - Total 1 236.3 1 032.9 7.5 32.3 0.6% 3.1% January - September 56% 17% 17% 10% Net sales Sweden Germany Norway Other countries  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (24)  www.acando.com  Profit trend per quarter   The graph on the right shows net sales and operating profit  for the past four years.   In terms of work, the fourth quarter is the most work  intensive with the highest number of working days. The  third quarter is always lower due to vacation.  The industry in which Acando operates is late-cyclical and a  weak market impacts with a delay of about one quarter. The  same applies when the market turns.           Development of operations by geographic market      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept is, in partnership with its customers, to create business value by  enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine skills in  strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations function. The  Group has approximately 1,800 employees allocated over seven countries.       Sweden  The merger and integration activities dominated the quarter in Sweden. A harmonized offering has been defined and a matching  customer relationship management (CRM) process has been implemented.  To some extent, integration efforts have been  impacted by utilization rates since the quarter made a weak start before recovering as CRM efforts intensified again. Despite  the weak start, operations in Sweden delivered a clear improvement in earnings across all geographies and business areas. The  geographies with the clearest improvement were Malmö and Stockholm.     Management Consulting trended positively during the quarter through the expansion of existing customers as well as through  a number of new public-sector assignments. IT Management Consulting also trended favorably with new assignments in several  sectors. Demand grew primarily in the banking and finance sector, which has led to new assignments with possibilities for further  expansion.    Business Systems posted a strong trend in both SAP and MS Dynamics.  The merger of the operations makes Acando a leading  company, which was confirmed by the Dynamics AX Partner of the Year award from Microsoft. Major ongoing projects drive  utilization rates in parallel with new possibilities providing a secure foundation moving forward. Margins will be strengthened  through integrating delivery components from our offshore operations in both administration and projects, which will also  provide increased resource flexibility, something that is demanded by increasing numbers of customers.

Germany and Norway have made significant progress and continued to trend positively in terms of margin and growth  in the third quarter. Over the last few years, we have driven changes in the structures and offerings in both countries  and are now starting to see the results. In the first nine months, the margin improved for operations in Sweden, however  we have identified significantly more potential to be gained from a favorable position in a market with many  opportunities, both in terms of margins and growth.   In the Digital area, we have noted how customers prioritize innovation, particularly innovation driven in short cycles  with clear targets to create business value. We have also noted how an increasing number of customers have chosen to  create a digital foundation, to work to create a long-term, sustainable digital platform through clear choices of  architecture and approaches to areas, such as integration, process efficiency, cloud-based deliveries and information  analysis. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the businesses we are meeting are in two different cycles, one being  innovation driven and the other driven by endurance. This characterizes all parts of our offering, and we are well- positioned to support both cycles at our customers. In particular, we are now seeing evidence of how the need for skills  from strategic insight to immediate realization is decisive for taking the right decisions in an increasingly complex and  fast-moving reality. Acando's study, Digital Insights 2015 provides insight into the most important digital issues at 200  of the largest companies in Sweden. On the 27th of November, we will launch the full results of the study, so far we  have three important conclusions;  - Attracting and retaining top digital talent is becoming more and more important.  - Innovation merge companies' overall strategy work with the digital business.  - The company's own ability to drive transformation on a large scale, is a concern.   We will also gradually increase interaction between our geographies and skills areas to thereby take an increasingly  clear digital position. We have already noted how we have strengthened positions in the retail and energy sectors  through strong links between countries and the customers we manage across national borders. The partnership with  Avensia and Microsoft that was launched during the quarter creates excellent possibilities for accelerating growth in e- commerce throughout our geographies.  We are continuing our shared journey together with employees, customers and partners. We are driven by the desire to  create value and promote new talents at Acando and our customers. We are proud over the trust our customers show  in us, particularly when customers who have worked with us for a long time extend that trust with new assignments.  We continue to drive the packaging of solutions for accelerated value creation, the right mix of on/nearshore deliveries  for cost-efficiency and customer and assignment size for increased utilization rates.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (28)  www.acando.com  Acando is well-positioned to continue growing and our focus is currently on recruiting in all areas. A key element is our  trainee program and, in August, two new programs started; Acando Nova 13 and Acando Nova 14. For the first time, the  program was established outside of Stockholm, with trainees from Gothenburg and Malmö. We are also poised to expand  the next round of trainee programs to include Norway. Our trainee program builds Acando and also provides us with  new perspectives, talents and access to ambition, which is unlike anything I have ever seen and which has been noted  by a number of our customers who have asked “Are there any Novos assigned to the project?”.   Significant events    Third quarter, 2015  Acando in Germany developed a mobile app, together with the telecoms operator E-Plus, to make it easier for consumers  to interact with local retailers.     Acando offers strategic consulting services and application development for SAP with Fiori/SAPUI5, a new concept for  mobile and location-independent operation of SAP programs. The technology and practical examples were demonstrated  at the annual German SAP user forum’s conference that took place in the third quarter.    Acando and Avensia, e-commerce leaders in the Scandinavian market, started the quarter with a strategic partnership  for e-commerce solutions. The combination of industry expertise and e-commerce skills, together with experience of  implementing cloud-based ERP solutions as well as the ability to deliver the solution as a service for rapid distribution  creates a competitive advantage in the rapidly changing retail sector with consequent excellent opportunities for  growth.    Acando has received access to Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle by delivering valuable solutions that help organizations  to achieve increased success. Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle comprises a group of Microsoft’s most strategic and  important Microsoft Dynamics partners from around the world. Microsoft ranks its partners around the world based on  sales and performance and some 60 partners are invited to join the Inner Circle each year.    Acando in Norway completed the acquisition of the operations of the Antares Group and, thereby obtained the services  of another 20 senior consultants from September 1. The Antares Group primarily comprises consultants with expertise  in systems development, architecture, consulting services, integration and project management. The company has  provided both front-end and back-end consulting services, the largest skills area being Java.      Significant events after the end of the period  Acando in Norway have been awarded a framework agreement with the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service (NAV),  for architecture and software requirement specification consulting services.    In Norway, Acando won a framework agreement with the Norwegian Police’s Shared Services (PFT), for the procurement  of architecture services for justice sector operations.    Acando launched Acando Digital Insights in 2015, the most important digital insights based on the study of 200 large  Swedish companies.     INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (28)  www.acando.com  Business activities        Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept, in partnership with its customers, is to create business value  by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,800 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and delivery centers in  India and Latvia.        Acando’s offering    Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in place to  be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish company with a  sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions to be able to successfully  compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:    Management pertains to consulting services and accelerated implementation in connection with strategic change and  includes innovation and optimizing the use of technology as key elements of the offering. Disruptive business models,  enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and demand  for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.     Enterprise drives projects based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems are key to  driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX and SAP,  with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle. Continued  efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s move toward  cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where Acando has a  favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.      Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are driven by a  combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on modern technology  and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly  growing areas.     INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (28)  www.acando.com  Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.    Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.                 Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry.     The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer behavior patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted driven by  a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In combination with  regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many companies in the  sector.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. A declining propensity for investment has  been noted in the oil and gas segment.     INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (28)  www.acando.com  The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven both by demands for efficiency  and increased transparency, and for digital interaction with citizens.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  players.              Market trend in the third quarter  The demand in Sweden has remained healthy and on a par with the start of 2015, albeit with certain geographical  differences where Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region are performing best. In Germany, the demand situation  remained normal, which was also the case for Norway even if certain indications were noted for the private sector of a  decline in the willingness to invest. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious and assignments  are both fewer and subject to intense competition. For 2015, demand is expected to finish in line with how it started.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation, implementation and technology.

Harvested  volumes were 13 thousand tonnes gutted weight in Q3 2015. The combined farming and VAP seg- ments made an operational EBIT of DKK 191.9 million in Q3 2015. The Farming segment made an  operational EBIT of DKK 182.8 million. The global salmon spot prices increased during the quarter,  consequently the VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 9.0 million in Q3 2015. The EBITDA  for the FOF segment was DKK 41.7 million in Q3 2015.    The Group made a profit for the quarter of DKK  168.1 million (DKK 211.2 million). For the first nine  months of 2015, the profit was DKK 491.6 million  (DKK 424.7 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q3 2015 were  12,982 tonnes gutted weight (10,881 tgw). Total  harvested volumes the first nine months of 2015  were 36,890 tonnes gutted weight (31,362 tgw).  The increased volumes are as planned. Bakkafrost  will harvest higher volumes in 2015, compared to  the year before.    Bakkafrost transferred 2.8 million smolts in Q3  2015 (2.2 million), which is in line with the com- pany’s plans. The first nine months of 2015,  Bakkafrost has transferred 6.4 million smolts (7.2  million).    The combined farming and VAP segments made  an operational EBIT of DKK 191.9 million (DKK  193.4 million) in Q3 2015. For the first nine months  of 2015, the combined farming and VAP segment  made an operational EBIT of DKK 688.6 million  (DKK 550.1 million).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 182.8 million (DKK 166.9 million) in Q3 2015.  The harvested volumes are higher in Q3 2015,  compared to Q3 2014, while operational EBIT mar- gin was lower, mainly due to increased cost. For  the first nine months of 2015, the operational EBIT  was DKK 626.2 million (DKK 512.6 million).    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 9.0 million (DKK 26.5 million) for Q3 2015.  The operational EBIT in the VAP segment de- creased due to higher prices on raw material in the  quarter. For the first nine months of 2015, the oper- ational EBIT was DKK 62.4 million (DKK 37.5 mil- lion).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 41.7 million (DKK 61.7  million) in Q3 2015. This corresponds to an oper- ational EBITDA margin of 13.0% (21,5%). The op- erational EBITDA was DKK 157.3 million for the  first nine months of 2015 (DKK 140.8 million), cor- responding to an EBITDA margin of 19.5% (18,9%)  for the first nine months of 2015.  In Q3 2015, Havsbrún sourced 10,417 tonnes of  raw material (19,782 tonnes) and for the first nine  months of 2015, Havsbrún sourced 171,432 ton- nes of raw material (171,313 tonnes).  The live fish carrier “Hans á Bakka” was delivered  to Bakkafrost in Q3 2015. The capacity is 450 ton- nes of live fish, and the ship is equipped with state  of the art technology. The investment in “Hans á  Bakka” will increase transport capacity and at the  same time reduce biological risks. Following the  delivery, finalising instalment of equipment and re- quired tests were carried out in Q3 2015.  The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 181.7 million at the end of Q3  2015 (DKK 232.7 million at year-end 2014) includ- ing deposits and losses on financial derivatives re- lating to the interest bearing debt. Bakkafrost had  undrawn credit facilities of approximately DKK  802.3 million, of which DKK 18.1 million were re- stricted at the end of Q3 2015.  Bakkafrost’s equity ratio at 30 September 2015 is  63%, compared with 60% at the end of 2014.             Condensed Consolidated Interim Report for Q3 2015 and First Nine Months 2015 Issued November 3rd 2015       4  Farming and VAP performance per kg      Q3   Q3     YTD   YTD  Operational EBIT/kg   2015   2014     2015   2014  Farming EBIT/kg (DKK)    14.08    15.34      16.98   16.34  Farming EBIT/kg (NOK)   17.25   17.02     20.03   18.15  VAP EBIT/kg (DKK)    2.41    6.10      4.68   2.33  VAP EBIT/kg (NOK)   2.95   6.77     5.52   2.58      Smolt transfer    Bakkafrost Group                            1,000 pieces        2011   2012   2013   2014   2015E  Farming North        5,000   6,500   7,200   3,000   6,600  Farming West        2,600   4,200   2,300   7,400   3,800  Viking        1,000   0   0   0   0   Total        8,600   10,700   9,500   10,400   10,400

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2016     Price-sensitive information that   has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority    ___________________________________________________________________________________________________        1 (29)        INTERIM REPORT    THIRD QUARTER, JULY 1–SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   Net sales of SEK 469 m (427)   Operating profit SEK 33 m (22)      Operating margin 7.1% (5.1)     Profit after tax was SEK 28 m (14)   Earnings per share were SEK 0.27 (0.14)  ACCUMULATED, JANUARY 1–SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   Net sales of SEK 1,573 m (1,550)   Operating profit SEK 129 m (106)      Operating margin 8.2% (6.9)     Profit after tax was SEK 113 m (71)   Earnings per share were SEK 1.09 (0.68)   Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 68 m (45)   Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  We posted continued strong financial growth, with profits up 50 percent and year-on-year growth of 10 percent for the  third quarter of 2016. Increasingly, we are converting market opportunities into larger assignments at and deeper  relationships with our major customers. Accordingly, we need to continue growing, and it is pleasing to note the expansion  of our talent pool, we need each one of you and more besides. We were therefore particularly pleased to capture an  honorable fifth place on the list of the most popular trainee programs in Sweden.    An even more pleasing fact is Acando’s continued development in line with the path we staked out together, and I am  proud of the progress on the journey we are currently undertaking together with our customers and staff. During the  summer, when we gathered all our talent to relate our customer stories to each other, I realized that there is so much to  tell — how the driving forces of customer and user behavior, as well as technology, comprise decisive factors. How the  capacity to create insight and energy in transformations is our trademark and how insights into business models and  architecture make our assignments successful. We want everyone to experience a modern digital workplace — we see  how all the channels combine into a single experience, and we believe that the customer and the patient journey should  be the same journey. We believe that vehicles are best when running themselves, we know that customer insight is more  than customer data, and we are delighted to drive a cloud transformation and to link up the railway or a car. We  understand that the digital preconditions open entirely new markets to our customers and we are proud of the compiled  potential of all our talent. But above all, we are absolutely convinced that the personal commitment of each and every  one of us represents our way of earning our customers’ confidence.    During the quarter, this confidence has manifested itself in a number of major, new projects. Electrolux has tasked us  with implementing a new global digital workplace, which is based on Microsoft Office 365 and Acando’s packaged solution  Acando Collaboration Platform (ACP), which has been implemented at some 40 customers. Together with a partner,  Acando has won a procurement in Norway for a project aimed at defining and building a new digital solution to manage  parental insurance among other things. Once again, the project demonstrates Acando’s strong position as a public sector  supplier in Norway and is one of the largest assignments in Acando’s history.    I would also like to welcome the German firm Brickmakers to Acando. With its clear profile in mobile and web-based  applications, the acquisition strengthens the Group’s already favorable position as a complete digital supplier. Acando  wants to be a natural partner for our customers’ digital adventures and Brickmakers strengthens that position.      INTERIM REPORT   January 1–September 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (29)  www.acando.com  Acando’s vision is “A more capable world,” and through each assignment we create greater capabilities; in ourselves, our  employees, our customers and in our operating environment.      Significant events during and after the quarter        In Norway, Acando has signed an agreement with Sopra Steria regarding case management projects for the Norwegian  Labour and Welfare Service (NAV). Acando is supplying skills and capacity in the fields of architecture and system  development. The agreement applies for an initial period of three years and is maximized at seven years.    In Sweden, Acando has signed an agreement with Electrolux to implement a new global digital workplace. The contract  extends for three years with an option to extend for a further two years and covers realization and administration. The  new digital workplace is based on Microsoft Office 365 and Acando’s packaged solution Acando Collaboration Platform  (ACP).    Acando is helping the Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DiFi) in Norway to develop a solution that  automates mandatory transparency processes in state-owned operations. The goal is to streamline the services that make  documents available to the public.    In Germany, Acando has acquired Brickmakers Gmbh and, thereby obtained the services of another 25 senior consultants  from October 2016. Brickmakers Gmbh consists mainly of skilled consultants in the design, development and usability of  mobile and web-based applications.     Acando was named Innovator of the Year and CRM partner at the Microsoft Partner Awards. Acando was awarded the prize  for successfully breaking new ground during the year with its innovative solution built on Microsoft’s healthcare  technology, which harnesses complex underlying data to generate suggestions as to how we can diagnose and care for  patients in the future. Acando’s Microsoft CRM-based customer care project has helped customers’ digital transformation,  which resulted in the award for CRM partner of the year.    In September, Acando arranged the Ett friskare Sverige (A Healthier Sweden) conference, where the respective parties in  the Swedish sickness benefits process met to discuss how to reduce sick leave in society. During the quarter, Acando  established itself as a partner to county councils with regard to ongoing efficiency enhancements.              INTERIM REPORT   January 1–September 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (29)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept is, in partnership with its customers, to create business value by  enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,600 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and a delivery center in  Latvia.        Acando’s offering    Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of all of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in  place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish company with a  sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions to be able to successfully  compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:    Management pertains to consulting services and accelerated implementation in connection with strategic change and  includes innovation and optimizing the use of technology as key elements of the offering. Disruptive business models,  enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and demand  for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.     Within Enterprise projects are driven based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems  are key to driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX  and SAP, with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle.  Continued efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s  move toward cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where  Acando has a favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.      Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are driven by a  combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on modern technology  and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly  growing areas.    Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1–September 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (29)  www.acando.com      Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.               Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both Sweden and Germany, and  with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway.     The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major full-service assignments with  several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted that is  driven by a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In  combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many  companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments linked to leading the transformation and  development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. Given historically low oil prices, a   INTERIM REPORT   January 1–September 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (29)  www.acando.com  declining propensity for investment has been noted in the oil and gas segment. Acando has extensive experience and a  strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy companies and a number of smaller local companies.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for efficiency,  increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong position in Norway comprises the base for  continued expansion in terms of content and geographical coverage.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.  Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.            Market trend in the third quarter  Demand in Sweden remained healthy and on a par with 2015, albeit with certain geographical differences where  Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region comprise clear growth areas. In Germany, demand remained normal during the  period. The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with an increasingly  noticeable decline in the willingness to invest in oil-related sectors, thus resulting in increasing competition for available  assignments. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious.     Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation, implementation and technology.

Harvested volumes were 10.7 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined farming and  VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 247.6 million. The farming segment made  an operational EBIT of DKK 294.3 million and the high salmon spot prices had a positive  effect on the farming segment. The high salmon spot prices affected the VAP segment  negatively, and the VAP Segment made an operational EBIT of DKK -46.7 million. The  EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 62.4 million.      The Group made a profit for the third quarter 2016 of  DKK 346.4 million (DKK 168.1 million). For the first  nine months of 2016, the profit was DKK 783.4 million  (DKK 491.6 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q3 2016 were 10,664  tonnes gutted weight (12,982 tgw). Total harvested  volumes in the first nine months of 2016 were 34,890  tonnes gutted weight (36,890 tgw).     Bakkafrost transferred 3.8 million smolts during Q3  2016 (2.8 million), which is in line with the company’s  plans. Transferred smolts for the first nine months of  2016 were 7.7 million smolts (6.4 million).    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 247.6 million (DKK 191.9  million) in Q3 2016. For the first nine months of 2016,  the combined farming and VAP segment made an  operational EBIT of DKK 773.0 million (DKK 688.6  million).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 294.3 million (DKK 182.8 million) in Q3 2016.  The harvested volumes are lower, while the average  spot price is higher in Q3 2016, compared with Q3  2015. For the first nine months of 2016, the  operational EBIT was DKK 912.9 million (DKK 626.2  million).    In July 2016 a routine surveillance test detected a  possible pathogenic ISA-virus at a Bakkafrost farming  site, A-73 Hvannasund Norður. After the suspicion,  extensive tests have been carried out at the farming  site with the purpose of confirming the suspicion.  None of the results from these tests proved the  presence of pathogenic ISA virus. The Veterinary  Authority has increased surveillance for at least six  months after the suspicion at the farming site and  performs extra tests on neighbouring farming sites as  well. The ISA suspicion has not affected Bakkafrost’s  financial performance in Q3 2016.    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  -46.7 million (DKK 9.0 million) for Q3 2016. As in the  previous quarter, the high spot prices had a negative  effect on the operational EBIT in the VAP segment. In  Q3 2016, Bakkafrost has renegotiated higher prices  for part of the 2016 contracts. The new prices are  effective from September 2016, and thus the effect in  Q3 2016 is limited. For the first nine months of 2016,  the operational EBIT was DKK -139.9 (DKK 62.4  million).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 62.4 million (DKK 41.7  million) in Q3 2016, and the EBITDA margin was  19.5% (13.0%). The operational EBITDA was DKK  176.8 million for the first nine months of 2016 (DKK  157.3 million), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of  21.4% (19.5%).    During Q3 2016, Havsbrún sourced 11,003 tonnes  (10,417 tonnes) of raw material, and for the first nine  months of 2016, Havsbrún sourced 166,542 tonnes  (171,432 tonnes) of raw material.    Bakkafrost acquired the remaining outstanding  shares (51%) in P/F Faroe Farming on the 1st of July  2016. Simultaneously, Bakkafrost relinquished two  farming licenses to the Faroese Authorities in order to  comply with Faroese law. The relinquished farming  licenses are A-03 Svínáir and A-17/18 Hovsfjørður.  P/F Faroe Farming is a salmon farming company and  operates in the southern part of the Faroe Islands.   INTERIM REPORT FOR Q3 2016 and FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2016                 BAKKAFROST    |  4  |    ISSUED NOVEMBER 8th 2016       From the 1st of July 2016, the farming operation of P/F  Faroe Farming is part of Bakkafrost Farming West.

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2017  Price-sensitive information that  Has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (26)  Interim report    Third quarter, July 1–September 30, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 518 m (469)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 27 m (33)   > The operating margin was 5.2% (7.0)  > Profit after tax was SEK 17 m (28)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.17 (0.27)    Accumulated, January 1–September 30, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 1,753 m (1,573)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 157 m (128)   > The operating margin was 8.9% (8.2)  > Profit after tax was SEK 113 m (113)  > Earnings per share were SEK 1.09 (1.09)  > Cash, cash equivalents totaled SEK 59 m (68)  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  We continue to grow and posted growth of just over 10 percent in the first nine months of the year in parallel  with growing our earnings by 23 percent. At the end of Q3, we have 100 more employees in Sweden than at  the start of the quarter, we have more than 400 employees in Germany and we are approaching 300  employees in Norway. Altogether, we now number 250 consultants more than at the start of the year and  150 more than at the start of Q3. The considerable influx of new employees negatively impacted the quarter’s  earnings, however, all geographies reported rising utilization rates and increasing demand in all skills areas  driven by innovation, digitalization and completely new applications for integrated technology in services and  products.  During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Norwegian company Bitvis, which focuses  on advanced software development services. The acquisition is part of our aim to build a strong chain from  built-in and software-defined product properties, and IoT-based solutions to advanced analytics and machine  learning. The acquisition of Bitvis means we create a very unique combination of capabilities that enable  entirely new functions, from data collection via pre-processing data to advanced algorithms where Bitvis’s  capability in advanced software design comprises a crucial component.   We have also established the Acando Business Design Studio — where customer, technology and strategy  perspectives meet. The add-on acquisitions of Daytona and Transformator Design mean we are now a leader  in the creation of exceptional customer experiences and hold a unique position from which we can not only  support definitions of strategies with a strong customer focus, but are also able to realize these through  transformative projects ranging from the creation of in-house digital capabilities to the realization of technical  solutions. Our compiled expertise makes us unique in the Nordic market.  In pace with ever accelerating development; new regulatory and security-related requirements are also being  stipulated. Acando’s fastest growing skills area is Security and Compliance, where the Group now has some  one hundred employees. This includes skills in everything from cyber security to the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR), and all focused on safe and correct information management. Acando’s GDPR offering  focuses on combining regulatory compliance with long-term sustainable information architecture, and we  already have some 40 customers, from small start-ups to global conglomerates.  We believe the world will increasingly be driven by technology but that understanding of human behavior will  always be key to creating the best solutions. It’s what we are — Technology Driven and Behavior Centric.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (26)  Significant events during and after the quarter  Acando has won an assignment to create a modern mobile-friendly interface for a market-leading poultry  producer. The new interface will strengthen the producer’s market position and simplify communication with  poultry farmers. Instead of communicating by e-mail and telephone as before, communication will now be  through a modern, mobile-friendly interface.    Acando Norway won a framework agreement for consulting services with the Brønnøysund Register Centre  (Norwegian company registrations office). The agreement covers the development of a new electronic case  management system for registry operations. The project’s main concept is to develop a new digital registry  platform. The aim is to replace outdated system solutions in time to ensure the continued ability of the  Brønnøysund Register Centre to provide good registry services, adapted to new requirements and  expectations as a result of the transition to digital administration. The contract is for three years with an  option to extend for a maximum of four further years.    Acando won an award in 2017 as a Microsoft partner. Acando won the prize for the most innovative solution  category with the commendation: “The winner has completed many successful projects in which it has used  creative solutions to help customers through their digital transformation. Achievements include helping a  customer to reduce food wastage by using Azure, Power BI and machine learning. For another customer,  machine learning has been used to identify which tenders to respond to and, in another case, a solution  has been prepared to determine which pneumonia patients are at risk of the illness escalating.” In 2017,  Acando received the Sweden Partner of the Year award, joined the Microsoft Inner Circle and has now  received the prize for the most innovative solution of the year.    Acando has won an assignment to assist a Swedish employers’ organization with adapting to the new EU  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The organization manages large amounts of personal data  and to protect their position, they want to pre-empt the Swedish Data Protection Authority’s and supervisory  bodies’ controls, and to ensure compliance with the GDPR and adequate risk exposure as well as to make  sure that personal integrity remains intact. In the first stage, Acando is delivering a fundamental analysis  and verification of the situation vis-à-vis personal data, and will provide recommendations regarding  protective measures within IT and business processes as well as assist with ongoing information and  support for operations.    One of Sweden’s largest retailers has enlisted Acando’s help in applying more agile working methods. The  retail market is currently undergoing massive change, with many new companies in the sector. Larger  retailers have to be fleet of foot to meet the competition and to retain their positions. The company is a  market leader and has strong financials but competition is intensifying as low-price companies, e-commerce  and traditional competitors capture larger shares of the market. Therefore, creating better conditions to  leverage internal resources and to deliver more impact to stores and to do that faster will prove decisive. A  key element of the change regards the customer’s desire for a more agile method of working. This will in  turn lead to an increased in-store impact and a shorter time-to-market. This will also lead to improved  conditions for employees and boost motivation and commitment.    Acando has won the assignment to help the newspaper publisher Albinsson & Sjöberg in their transition  toward a more digital media industry. The assignment includes digitalizing the publisher’s operations and  assisting ahead of digital transformation. In parallel with strategic issues, Acando also supports digital    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (26)  issues pertaining to operations in the company, such as the best method for communicating by newsletters  and how to optimize e-commerce operations.    Acando acquired the two companies Transformator Design and Daytona on September 1. Together with  Acando’s own operations, offerings within strategy, design, technology, innovation, change management  and communication are being created. Through these acquisitions, Acando gained 60 additional  employees, who will contribute by creating strategies and designing solutions based on customers’ needs  for all channels. The new operations will be consolidated into the Acando Group from September 1, 2017.    All of the shares in the Norwegian company Bitvis AS were acquired after the end of the period. Bitvis is a  design center for FPGA and embedded software development. The company provides highly specialized  development services to a broad spectrum of customers from start-ups, to major companies in the  electronics industry. Bitvis is involved in many prestigious projects within space, defense, offshore,  telecommunications, avionics, radar systems, multimedia devices, industrial applications and healthcare.  Bitvis has also developed unique tools, intellectual property, in the form of simulation software for field- programmable gate array (FPGA) verification. Through the acquisition, Acando strengthens its digital  transformation offering. Everything related to Industry 4.0 requires deep technological know-how, and the  acquisition of Bitvis forms a key step in assisting our clients within IoT, embedded software and FPGA  (programmable digital logic). The combination of Acando’s expertise in management consulting, advanced  analytics, machine learning and AI, will create a unique technology environment in the Norwegian market.  The new operations will be consolidated into the Acando Group from October 1, 2017.    After the end of the period, Acando Norway and partners won a framework agreement with the Norwegian  Coastal Administration (NCA) for the development of information solutions for maritime data. The  agreement includes traditional business intelligence as well as more advanced analysis solutions and  algorithms.    After the end of the period, Acando won an assignment to support a major Swedish bank with ensuring  compliance with new EU requirements. On January 3, 2018, MiFID II will enter force. MiFID is the acronym  for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which is the EU’s revised directive and regulation for  markets in financial instruments, and regulates securities trading in the EU and ESS. The Regulation on  Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFIR) is an accompanying regulation with rules to be applied directly by  the member states. The main purpose of the directive is to strengthen investor protection, increase  transparency and disclosure in the securities markets and, at the same time, provide regulatory bodies with  an improved overview and control. The directive applies to essentially all securities markets participants,  and to almost all securities products and asset classes covered by the new regulatory framework. The  assignment includes responsibility for leading the program office and communication.           INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (26)  Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and  human behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change.

A high level of  innovation and efficiency enhancement in traditional industrial companies is enabled by digital capabilities  in product content, such as business models and processes. Acando is well-positioned to create completely  new possibilities in the segment, together with its customers, through a combination of transformative  implementations and deep technical expertise.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction  and e-commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also create the need for a  more flexible and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has  major full-service assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany  and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been  noted as a result of the need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with  customers. In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured  transformation programs at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments  linked to leading the transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and  Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and  external factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more  highly integrated services aimed at customers are increasing the need for more advanced digital platforms.

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2018  Price-sensitive information that  must be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (26)  Interim report    Third quarter, July 1–September 30, 2018  > Net sales totaled SEK 590 m (518)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 31 m (27)     > Operating margin was 5.2% (5.2)  > Profit after tax was SEK 32 m (17)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.30 (0.17)    Accumulated, January 1–September 30, 2018  > Net sales totaled SEK 2,029 m (1,753)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 181 m (157)   > Profit before non-recurring items SEK 186 m   > Operating margin was 8.9% (8.9)  > Profit after tax was SEK 147 m (113)  > Earnings per share were SEK 1.41 (1.09)  > Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 51 m  (59)  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In the third quarter of 2018, we continued to grow in a market where the demand for our services remains  healthy. Profit and sales posted a year-on-year increase of 14 percent and were up 16 percent for the first  nine months. Our trainee program continues to attract talent and during the summer, the largest batch of  trainees ever began their careers at Acando, and we are grateful that they have chosen us. At the same  time as competition for talent is intensifying and we are proud that at the end of the quarter our employee  numbers are at a new high, almost 200 more than at the start of the year and 70 more than at the start of  the quarter. Our ability to attract and retain the best employees will be critical for our continued journey,  and for continuing to create clear and empathetic environments in which our employees are encouraged to  challenge and develop — as professionals and as people.  The world around us is being driven more and more quickly by the opportunities technology provides. At  the same time, understanding human behavior and applying that knowledge in our daily operations is key  to creating the best solutions. Regulatory requirements and the importance of creating sustainable societal  benefit are becoming increasingly important components in many of our assignments.   Acando’s strategy  of being “Technology Driven and Behavior Centric” remains highly relevant, and we continue to deepen  and broaden our offering in order to retain that relevance in a rapidly changing world.   We are strengthening our offering by adding new talent and can thereby always capture a stronger and  more innovative market position. The acquisition of Alterview makes us not only the leading partner in  cloud-based business systems and NetSuite, it also provides us with access to some of the most innovative  and fastest growing customers in the digital service-based industry.  We can also see how innovative processes and technology’s possibilities require the integration of a design  mindset across the entire process. Through the acquisition of Inventas, we have created a full-range  technology chain, from sensors and embedded software to award-winning industrial design, and not least,  access to advanced analytics skills and industrial system integration. This provides us with a unique position  in industrial digitalization and application of the Internet of Things.  We are also looking forward to continued exciting developments in a few of Acando’s strategically focused  growth areas, such as Retail and Healthcare. We are proud of developing together with new and well- established customers and the confidence invested in us, and we share in their journey in a changeable  world. MQ’s vision of a more engaging customer experience and Avonova’s ambition to create a new type  of data-driven healthcare are just a few examples.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (26)  Significant events during and after the quarter  Acando signed an agreement with Avonova Företagshälsa for the development of entirely new types of  data-driven services in occupational healthcare. Avonova is one of Sweden’s leading occupational  healthcare companies and continuously develops its services based on new digital possibilities. Over the  years, considerable occupational health data has been accumulated and this will now be harnessed as a  foundation for innovative business development.      During the quarter, all of the shares in Alterview Net Solution AB were acquired by Acando Sweden. This  acquisition reinforces Acando’s focus on cloud-based business systems and in partnership with Acando’s  own operations, is creating the leading partner for implementing NetSuite solutions in northern Europe. The  new operations were consolidated into the Acando Group from September 1, 2018.    Trustly Group has chosen Acando as its partner for the implementation of the NetSuite ERP system. The  new system will enhance the efficiency of the company’s processes and simplify continued international  expansion.      Acando has implemented a tailor-made B2B portal for Kronfågel, a subsidiary of Scandi Standard, with the  aim of digitalizing communication with broiler breeders and increasing the company’s competitiveness in  the long term.      Acando supports Nordic push for inclusion — social entrepreneurs receive help from consultants with  scaling up their operations.  Ashoka, the world leading organization for social entrepreneurship, has chosen  ten social entrepreneurs to take part in a four month accelerator program — Hello Nordics. As part of the  program the entrepreneurs will get access to consultants from Acando helping them to scale their activities.      Acando has won an assignment to implement a new e-commerce solution for MQ. Seamless and engaging  customer experiences, both in store and online, with easier purchasing and returns, and improved service  are the goals, and the project forms a key cornerstone in MQ’s digital transformation with the aim of  contributing to a leading position in the fashion segment.     To meet an increasing global demand and to strengthen its offering within Dynamics, Acando signed a  strategic partnership agreement with the tech company Sonata. The partnership enables close  collaboration between Dynamics specialists with proven ability to deliver with high quality, speed and  precision.    After the end of the period, Acando Norway acquired all of the shares in the design and product  development company Inventas AS. Inventas consists of designers and product developers with  backgrounds from both industrial design and engineering. Acando is driven by how technology can change  society and an increasing number of physical objects are being connected to the internet, where they  communicate with each other and process available information. Inventas is the best at designing physical  products and with Acando’s skills in embedded electronics together with deep knowledge in data processing  with cloud-based solutions, AI and digital user interfaces, a complete offering is created. The new  operations will be consolidated into the Acando Group from October 1, 2018.     INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (26)  Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and  human behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change. Our  customers come from every sector and include a mix of major global organizations as well as medium- sized regional companies. We operate in a Northern European market with offices in Sweden, Finland,  Norway, Germany and Latvia, and have a total of 2,100 employees.    Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results, and value for the customer achieved through a combination  of all of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationships with customers. Well-established methods and tools  are in place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.  The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting  companies as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish  company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital  solutions to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project  implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:  Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are  driven by a combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based  on modern technology and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well- positioned in several of the most rapidly growing areas in terms of user-centric solutions and digital product  innovation as well as industrial transformation through digitalization. We are entering a new era, when work  processes are partially replaced or expanded with digital solutions, which means that IT is no longer just  business support, but also functions as an expansion or integrated part of our customers’ processes,  products, services and entire business. Acando’s Business Design Studio is part of the operations, whereby  customer-centric strategies and digital innovation are core elements for creating the best customer  experiences.  Consulting is active in all major industries and offers in-depth expertise in Strategy, Operational Control,  Sales & Marketing, Supply Chain and Operations. Acando’s broad knowledge base and cross-functional  business teams ensure a holistic perspective and good understanding of the customers, which means that  we can offer innovative perspectives and solutions that generate unexpected added value. Acando’s  absolute strength is the transformation process and its high speed of implementation.   Enterprise is the leading Swedish supplier of platform-related services on selected platforms: SAP,  Dynamics AX and NetSuite. Together with our customers, we ensure that maximum value is created from  platform investments. We combine extensive operational expertise and well-tried methodology with  functional and technical platform competence.   Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over  time, Acando aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and  delivered projects.        INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (26)  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.         Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for  long-term, stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different  segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business- development assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both  Sweden and Germany, and with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway. A high level of  innovation and efficiency enhancement in traditional industrial companies is enabled by digital capabilities  in product content, business models and processes. Acando is well-positioned to create completely new  possibilities in the segment, together with its customers, through a combination of transformative  implementations and deep technical expertise.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction  and e-commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also create the need for a  more flexible and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has  major full-service assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany  and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been  noted as a result of the need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with  customers. In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured  transformation programs at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments  linked to leading the transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and  Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and  external factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more  highly integrated services aimed at customers are increasing the need for more advanced digital platforms.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–September 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  5 (26)  Acando has extensive experience and a strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy  companies as well as a number of smaller local companies.  The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make  it well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by  demands for efficiency, increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong  position in Norway comprises the base for continued expansion in terms of content and geographical  coverage.    The healthcare segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused  on efficient information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of  digital interaction. Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the  segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using  standard platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater  value. The media and entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact  with consumers and professional operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.    See below for the share of sales by customer segment.        Market trend  Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation, digital content in products and services, and completely new application areas for  technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become crucial to create clear links between strategy,  innovation, implementation, user behavior and technology.

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1 – September 30, 2012     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Financial Supervisory Authority            1 (21)        INTERIM REPORT    Third quarter, July 1 - September 30, 2012   Net sales SEK 321 m (326)   Operating profit SEK 18 m (4)     Operating margin 5.5% (1.4%)   Profit after tax SEK 12 m (loss: 3).   Earnings per share after dilution amounted to   SEK 0.17 (loss: 0.04).        Accumulated, January 1 – September 30, 2012   Net sales SEK 1,137 m (1,109)   Operating profit SEK 81 m (63)     Operating margin 7.1% (5.7%)   Profit after tax SEK 58 m (37)   Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK  0.80 (0.49).   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 75 m (99)      Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  During the year, our focus has been on organic growth. In the third quarter, over one hundred new employees started at  Acando including experienced consultants and younger members of staff, who participated in our Academies through which  we ensure access to critical skills for the future.  We are proud of our ability to attract the best consultants through offering  exciting assignments and a tightly-knit fellowship with other colleagues.   After the summer, a general slowdown and weaker demand was noted than earlier in the year, although, the market situation  varied according to geography and range of services offered. In general, we anticipate somewhat higher demand in the  Management Consulting, Strategic IT and Business Systems areas of expertise, while demand in IT Consulting is somewhat  weaker. In a weaker market, we are now moving our operative focus to margin management and efficiency and  consequentially, a somewhat lower inflow of new consultants over the coming quarter.  In Sweden, we had a major inflow of new personnel during the quarter in line with our growth objective. In parallel, a major  product was concluded early during the latter part of the quarter, which, taken in combination, led to a decline in the  utilization rate for operations in Sweden. Although we have noted increased inertia in the decision processes for projects and a  somewhat lower level of demand for expert services, we are still acting from a position of strength. A broad customer base  with numerous ongoing projects in combination with a vigorous sales focus means that we are in a favorable position for  returning to the normal utilization rate for operations in Sweden in the fourth quarter.    In Germany, we have continued initiatives to raise efficiency, broaden the customer base and increase the focus of the offering  during the quarter. The broader customer base provides us with enhanced opportunities to manage business cycles based  variations while enabling more rapid organic growth in a healthy market.  First and foremost, it is operations in southern  Germany that are growing vigorously.  Growth in Norway during the first three quarters, more than 15%, which also gives a direct impact in terms of margin  improvement in the quarter. By being selected as a strategic partner, as part of a consortium with Steria as the main party, in a  major modernization program within the public sector we will further strengthen our position. The agreement is one of the  largest in the history of Acando. IT architecture is our main responsibility, but the agreement also includes services from the   Acando portfolio in Management Consulting and IT Consulting. The agreement will be an important platform to continue to  grow our area Strategic IT in Norway, both in the public and private sector, as it makes us a very attractive place to work with  substantial extent in key roles in one of the largest and most advanced IT projects in Norway.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (21)  www.acando.com   Significant events    Third quarter, 2012  In the third quarter, Acando signed an agreement with the Finnish media Group Alma Media concerning the delivery of Alma  Media’s new financial system. Acando will deliver a solution based on the comprehensive and flexible business system, SAP  Business All-in-One. The new financial system aims to harmonize process and work methods for Alma Media and replaces a  number of legacy systems that have been used in parallel in the Group.    As one of Microsoft’s major implementation partners for Dynamics CRM and Dynamics AX in the Nordic region, Acando was  awarded the assignment of implementing a new CRM system by the leading Norwegian manufacturer of maintenance-free  windows, H-Produkter AS, during the quarter.    Significant events after the end of the period  Acando has signed a framework agreement with Lantmännen Ekonomisk Förening for the delivery of IT services in general  and system integration in particular. The agreement runs for two years with the possibility of extension.     In Norway, a strategic partnership agreement for several years was signed. Acando is one part of a consortium with Steria as  the main parties involved in a major program of modernization in the public sector. Under the agreement, Acando get a key  responsibility for the area of IT Architecture, but also provides services in the Management Consulting and IT Consulting.    Business activities  Market development  In the third quarter, the market weakened with a slowdown principally affecting the markets in Sweden and Finland. The  clearest indicators are in Sweden, where a few customers concluded projects early and through increasing uncertainty with  accompanying delays being noted for decisions on new projects. In addition, the level of competition for expert areas  increased compared with earlier in the year. Prices remained stable in all markets during the quarter. Demand in the markets  in Germany and Norway remained level with the preceding quarters this year.    Customers and offering  Management Consulting continues to grow in significance and has captured a number of minor assignments during the year.  The Strategy and Transformation and Supply Chain Management areas, where efficiency projects are in high demand, posted  the healthiest trend.     The trend for Strategic IT was healthy and it fortified its position as one of Acando’s strongest areas of expertise. The  agreement with the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service demonstrates the unique positioning of Acando and provides  excellent opportunities for continued expansion in the area.    During the quarter, in the Business Systems area, Acando gained new commitments from customers including Sapa Nordic  Region for their work implementing Dynamics AX as an ERP platform. This project will run to, at the very least, summer 2013.  The CRM area continues to grow and agreements were signed in Norway, Sweden and Germany during the quarter. Demand  continues in SAP for further development and ongoing enhancements to previously implemented systems in parallel with a  number of major ongoing projects.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (21)  www.acando.com  Net sales and profit    Third quarter July – September 2012  Net sales and operating profit for the third quarter 2012 are shown in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2012 amounted to SEK 321 m (326).

Each quarter in the table corresponds to earnings for a full  year. Operating profit is recognized before goodwill  amortization, EBITA.   The EBITA margin was 8.1 percent for the last 12-month  period.        Development of operations by geographic market    Introduction  Acando is an IT and management consulting company with approximately 1,100 employees allocated over 18 offices in five  countries. The head office is in Stockholm and Sweden accounts for 54 percent of operations followed by Germany with 21  percent and Norway with 14 percent. The remaining 11 percent is accounted for by operations in Finland and the UK, which are  reported together under the item Other countries.    Sweden  Our recruiting initiative generated the intended effect, and during the third quarter, more than 80 new employees began  working at Acando in Sweden. Acando Microsoft Academy was started during the period, which is a training program that  Acando provides in agreement with Microsoft to equip young consultants with cutting-edge competence in Microsoft’s  products. 24 individuals were selected from many hundreds of applicants in this round, which provides an increased ability to  meet the demand from Acando’s customers for products from Microsoft’s portfolio.    Within the Business Systems area, Acando continues to strengthen its leading position in the Dynamics market in Sweden and  was awarded membership in the Microsoft Dynamics Presidents Club for the third consecutive year. Worldwide, only 5 percent  of all Microsoft’s Dynamics partners succeed in qualifying for this award. Acando is one of the companies in the Swedish  market that has the longest and widest experience of Microsoft Dynamics and, during the quarter, was the first in Sweden to  be certified for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Financials.      In the Management Consulting area, Acando continues to assist customers with organizational development and streamlining.  In the quarter, Acando assisted a major electronics chain with situation assessment and development of product strategies  including a review of the product range and pricing strategies. Acando’s strength in process analysis and its ability to propose  enhancements functions in a wide variety of industries and provides Acando with a broad customer base.    During the quarter, the utilization rate was impacted, to a certain extent, by the increased amount of personnel that joined in  parallel with a major customer project ending early. The effects of the above were felt most in the IT Consulting area and are  expected to dissipate over the next quarters.     INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – September 30, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (21)  www.acando.com  Germany  Operations in southern Germany also continued to develop positively with EADS as the primary customer. In addition, during  the quarter, operations in the Düsseldorf region picked up in the form of a key initial agreement for the implementation of a  solution for Identity and Access Management for a customer in the retail segment.  EADS continues to be Acando’s largest customer in the Hamburg region, but the proportion of new customers continued to  grow in the quarter, which is a key element of Acando’s strategy to broaden the customer base in the region to thereby  creating enhanced growth potential.  Acando in Germany continues to strengthen its position in Microsoft Dynamics CRM solutions. In addition to being awarded a  place in Microsoft Presidents Club, Acando has developed a branch-specific solution for non-profit organizations that work  with fund raising and donations as key income sources.  Acando Germany has also taken over a branch-specific solution for the  Financial Services area based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  Despite the macroeconomic situation, no directly negative effect on demand or orders was noted.     Norway  Acando in Norway continued to grow in a healthy market. All delivery areas trended well and both Oslo and the Trondheim  region posted healthy growth figures. Strategic IT, with increased volume to more customers accounted for the largest  growth, primarily driven by major public-sector framework agreements.    H-Produkter AS in Norway chose Acando as its supplier of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 to enhance its control over customer  activities. The choice of solution demonstrates that Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 provides growing companies with an  excellent overview of customer relations and marketing in a rapid and efficient manner. With Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011,  H-Produkter will have a complete CRM solution that quickly and easily provides access to all data regarding the company’s  customer relations.       Other countries  Finland: In Finland, sales were negatively impacted by cutbacks at one of Acando’s major customers. In addition, one major  project started later than planned during the quarter, which negatively impacted utilization rates. Several new customers have  initiated projects in the quarter, which indicates a return to normal profitability in the fourth quarter.    The UK: During the quarter, even more new customers have engaged Acando to supply project and program management  services. In parallel, the organization has been fine-tuned to better handle growth, where deliveries are made in the  Manchester and London areas.

In 2014 the Jan-Jun CAPEX includes the acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    The third quarter 2015 has seen a continued focus on our side on 1) the network upgrade, from 3G to 4G,  across Scandinavia, 2) growing our smartphone subscriber base in Norway and 3) securing further  funding to finance AINMT Group’s growth plans in Scandinavia and internationally.   In Norway, the network upgrade was finalized by early November 2015. The final site upgrades were  completed a couple of weeks behind schedule and the tuning and optimization of the network is expected  to be finalised during the first quarter of 2016. The upgrade of our Swedish and Danish networks were  finalized around the same period.   The planning and execution of the network upgrade has been an impressive logistical effort by ice.net in  Norway and Net1 in Denmark and Sweden as well as network and device partners. As a 4G-only network  provider in Scandinavia, AINMT is positioned well for the future.  On 30 September the parent company, AINMT Holdings AB, announced that USD 120 million funding was  secured to finance its ambitious growth plans in Scandinavia and internationally – including expansion  into Indonesia and the Philippines. The first USD 80 million was invested by an independent asset  management group as a new subordinated PIK loan with par value USD 80 million, of which USD 50  million was injected into AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS in October, and the additional USD 40 million  was provided as a perpetual callable subordinated convertible loan from Rasmussengruppen AS.  In sum, we have significantly strengthened our operational toolbox as well as our financial capacity in the  quarter. The funds raised will enable us to continue to pursue our aggressive growth strategy.   AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Third Quarter 2015  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (11)  Significant events during the third quarter     AINMT Holdings AB secures USD 120 million funding; the first USD 80 million as a subordinated  PIK loan maturing in 2030, disbursed early October, and the additional USD 40 million was  provided as a perpetual callable subordinated convertible loan from AINMT AS to AINMT  Holdings AB with a conversion price of SEK 79.84/share, funded by a corresponding loan from  Rasmussengruppen AS to AINMT AS, disbursed early November.   Denmark: Technology upgrade from 3G to 4G network completed in August    Significant events after the end of the period     USD 50 million from the USD 80 million PIK loan to AINMT Holdings AB was injected as  shareholder equity into AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS   Network upgrade in Norway physically completed in November 2015   Network upgrade in Sweden physically completed in October 2015   The High Yield bond in AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS successfully listed on Oslo Stock  Exchange on 10 November 2015    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 133 versus 93 for the equivalent period  the previous year.

Investments in tangible assets during the third quarter amounted to NOK 128,736 (8,700) thousands and  the corresponding numbers for the first nine months NOK 262,923 (22,535) thousands. These  investments are mainly related to implementation of the new network and capacity expansions, both on  existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    As a consequence of the 4G investments the depreciations of the 3G CDMA related network components  are significantly higher during 2015, and finally scrapped as the new network is taken in use.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the third quarter amounts to NOK 37,397 (3,766) thousands and  the total year-to-date amounts to NOK 50,484 (9,470) thousands. The third quarter 2015 was heavily  affected by extraordinary costs related to replacement of customer premises equipment (i.e. routers) in  Sweden and Denmark as a part of the network technology upgrade from 3G CDMA to 4G LTE. Other  non-recurring items are mainly related to inventory revaluations and restructuring measurements.

CEO’s statement    The main highlights for the third quarter 2016 was continued solid sales figures for our Norwegian operation,  migration of Norwegian smartphone customers across to our own 4G only network and IT platform, and  strengthening of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS’ balance sheet.     We’re very pleased that ice.net’s sales rate for mobile phone subscriptions has continued to be high  throughout the third quarter. This demonstrates clearly that its mobile phone offering is proving highly  popular amongst Norwegian consumers and businesses. The migration of consumer customers from Telia’s  network and IT platform across to ice.net was concluded in the quarter, as a result we plan on starting to  generate smartphone on-net traffic from Q1 2017. The number of calls generated by the migration process in  addition to the calls generated by new customers did result in longer than expected waiting time at customer  care in July and August, but this is now back to industry leading standard. As mentioned in the Q2 report, this  process expectedly increased churn, but still below industry average.     In August and September, B2B customers were migrated from Telia’s to ice’net’s network. As the B2B  segment for obvious reasons is a more demanding customer group, churn increased to above industry  average during and following the migration process.      Nevertheless, churn in both consumer and B2B segments have been offset by strong sales throughout the  quarter. This is why we in August decided to provide our Norwegian operation with added financial flexibility  through granting AINMT Scandinavian Holdings AS a shareholder loan from AINMT Holdings AB. The loan  had a cap of NOK 450 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million. The remaining 250 million was  disbursed in September and the full loan was converted into equity on 30 September 2016.     In Sweden, Net1 has yet again delivered a quarter with solid financial performance with a record high year- to-date EBITDA of SEK 49 million.   AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Third Quarter 2016  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (10)  Significant events during the third quarter     In August, following the share issue in AINMT AS and AINMT Holdings AB, the latter granted a  subordinated shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS of 450 million. The loan was fully  utilized during the quarter and then converted to Equity (share capital increase) on 30 September  2016.   Completed the migration of Norwegian consumer and B2B customer across to ice.net’s 4G-only  network    Significant events after the end of the period     AINMT AS announced on 21 November that it is contemplating a private placement of new shares  with the objective of raising gross proceeds of approximately NOK 500 – 800 million. The decision to  conduct a private placement is primarily driven by further growth ambitions in Norway – both in  terms of customer acquisition and network infrastructure build-out.

Harvested volumes were  7.2 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined  farming and VAP segments made an operational EBIT  of DKK 142.4 million. The farming segment made an  operational EBIT of DKK 139.6 million. The salmon  spot prices decreased in Q3 2018, compared to the  previous quarter. The price decrease had a negative  effect on the operational EBIT in the farming segment.  The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  2.8 million. The EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK  41.4 million.    The Group made a profit for Q3 2018 of DKK 355.9  million (DKK 56.2 million). For the first nine months of  2018, the profit was DKK 966.9 million (DKK 533.3  million).    The total volumes harvested in Q3 2018 were 7,217  tonnes gutted weight (11,585 tgw). Total harvested  volumes in the first nine months of 2018 were 32,356  tonnes gutted weight (43,145 tgw). The guidance for  harvest in 2018 is reduced by 3,000 tonnes gutted  weight, from 49,000 to 46,000 tonnes gutted weight.     3.3 million (3.2 million) smolts were transferred  during Q3 2018. During the first nine months of 2018,  9.2 million (6.5 million) smolts were transferred. One  million smolts – out of the 13.9 million smolts, which  were expected to be released in 2018 – will be  postponed for release in 2019. Thus, the new  expected smolt release for 2018 is 12.9 million  smolts.     The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 142.4 million (DKK 212.2  million) in Q3 2018. The operational EBIT per kg in Q3  2018 was DKK 19.73 (DKK 18.32), which corresponds  to NOK 25.34 (NOK 23.02) for the combined farming  and VAP segments. For the first nine months of 2018,  the combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 735.5 million (DKK 967.4  million).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 139.6 million (DKK 216.7 million) in Q3 2018. The  harvested volumes were lower, and the average spot  price was higher in Q3 2018, compared to Q3 2017.  For the first nine months of 2018, the operational  EBIT was DKK 761.3 million (DKK 1,079.4 million).    On 20 September 2018, Bakkafrost recorded elevated  mortality level at farming site A-81 Kolbanagjógv.  Poisonous species of algae were registered in the sea  at the farming site A-81 Kolbanagjógv when the  incident occurred. Approximately 700 thousand fish  with an average weight of 500 gramme live weight  died within a couple of hours. The fish at farming site  A-81 Kolbanagjógv was released into the sea in June  - August 2018. The Farming segment had a net  expense of DKK 7.2 million in Q3 2018 due to the  incident.    Farming activity has been at the farming site A-81  Kolbanagjógv for the past 30 years. Bakkafrost has  not observed any similar situations, neither at  farming site A-81 Kolbanagjógv, nor at any other  farming sites before or after the incident. The remain- ing fish at farming site A-81 Kolbanagjógv has not  been affected by the incident and is performing well.    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  2.8 million (DKK -4.5 million) for Q3 2018. For the first  nine months of 2018, the operational EBIT was DKK     -25.8 million (DKK -112.0 million).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  EBITDA of DKK 41.4 million (DKK 79.5 million) for Q3  2018, and the EBITDA margin was 11.7% (23.2%). The  EBITDA was DKK 193.9 million for the first nine  months of 2018 (DKK 172.5 million), corresponding to  an EBITDA margin of 19.8% (18.4%).    During Q3 2018, Havsbrún sourced 7,496 tonnes  (21,937 tonnes) of raw material, and for the first 9  months of 2018, Havsbrún sourced 255,987 tonnes  (291,604 tonnes) of raw material.    Bakkafrost has, through its recently established  subsidiary Bakkafrost US, signed an agreement in Q2  2018 to acquire the business and assets in North  Landing, which is a US salmon importer focusing on  the East Coast and has a sales office, handling and  processing facilities in Clifton, New Jersey, USA.  Through the acquisition, Bakkafrost will have a better  market access and better abilities to serve Bakka- frost’s customers in the US market. The acquisition of  North Landing was closed in Q3 2018.    The net interest-bearing debt amounted to DKK 286.4  million at the end of Q3 2018 (DKK 258.1 million at  year-end 2017). Undrawn credit facilities amounted  to DKK 1,204.9 million at the end of Q3 2018.     The equity ratio was 70% at 30 September 2018,  compared to 70% at the end of 2017.   BAKKAFROST | INTERIM REPORT | Q3 2018 AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 4        Financial Review   (Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year)    Income Statement  The operating revenue amounted to DKK 621.6  million (DKK 804.2 million) in Q3 2018, and for the  first nine months of 2018, the operating revenue  amounted to DKK 2,427.1 million (DKK 2,864.0  million).    The farming segment’s harvest volume was lower, and  the achieved prices were higher in Q3 2018, com- pared to the same quarter last year. The farming and  VAP segments had lower revenues because of lower  volumes, but higher prices in Q3 2018, compared to  Q3 2017. The FOF segment had somewhat lower  external revenue in Q3 2018, compared to Q3 2017.     Operational EBIT was DKK 168.3 million (DKK 251.8  million) in Q3 2018. The farming and FOF segments  had lower operational EBIT, while the VAP segment  had improved operational EBIT in Q3 2018, compared  to Q3 2017. For the first nine months of 2018, the  operational EBIT was DKK 844.4 million (DKK 1,046.4  million).    The fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological  assets amounted to DKK 293.5 million (DKK -155.1  million) in Q3 2018. The positive adjustment is due to  higher forward market prices for salmon at the end of  the quarter, compared to the beginning of the quarter.  For the first nine months of 2018, the fair value  adjustment amounted to DKK 435.4 million (DKK            -334.8 million).    Change in provisions for onerous contracts amounted  to DKK -11.0 million (DKK 12.2 million) in Q3 2018.  For the first nine months of 2018, the change in  provisions for onerous contracts amounted to DKK        -17.1 million (DKK 67.4 million).    In Q3 2018, there was a loss from associated com- panies amounting to DKK -2.5 million (DKK -1.0  million). For the first nine months of 2018, the result  from associated companies amounted to DKK -1.7  million (DKK -1.1 million).    The revenue tax amounted to DKK -14.1 million in Q3  2018 (DKK -23.7 million). The revenue tax decreased  because of lower harvested volumes, compared to the  same quarter last year. For the first nine months of  2018, the revenue tax was DKK -71.8 million (DKK         -99.4 million).    Net interests in Q3 2018 were DKK -0.7 million (DKK    -16.1 million). For the first nine months of 2018, net  interests were DKK -10.2 million (DKK -27.3 million).    Net taxes amounted to DKK -77.7 million (DKK -11.7  million) in Q3 2018. For the first nine months of 2018,  net taxes amounted to DKK -212.0 million (DKK               -117.8 million).    The result for Q3 2018 was DKK 355.9 million (DKK  56.2 million) and for the first nine months of 2018,  the result was DKK 966.9 million (DKK 533.3 million).  Statement of Financial Position  (Figures in parenthesis refer to end last year)    The Group’s total assets amounted to DKK 5,790.7  million (DKK 5,155.5 million) at the end of Q3 2018.    Intangible assets increased in the quarter and  amounted to DKK 388.9 million (DKK 376.7 million) at  the end of Q3 2018. The increase on DKK 12.3 million  is due to the acquisition of goodwill in Bakkafrost USA.     Property, plant and equipment amounted to DKK  2,788.8 million (DKK 2,570.4 million) at the end of Q3  2018. In Q3 2018, Bakkafrost made investments in  PP&E amounting to DKK 127.2 million.

The carrying amount (fair value) of biological assets  amounted to DKK 1,562.9 million (DKK 1,096.7  million) at the end of Q3 2018. Biological assets have  increased due to higher fair value adjustment, com- pared to year end 2017.

  DRAFT F                                                    ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS    THIRD QUARTER RESULTS    Q3 2017  THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2017                1  THIRD QUARTER 2017 SUMMARY    ⁎ Service revenue of NOK 335,728 thousand; 45% y-o-y growth  ⁎ EBITDA* of NOK -139,192 thousand  ⁎ Book equity of NOK 782,323 thousand      CEO’s statement    The third quarter 2017 was yet another growth quarter for ice group’s Scandinavian operation. Service revenues  grew 45% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting our significantly increased  Norwegian customer base.    Average smartphone on-net data traffic grew from 21% in the second quarter to 24% in the third quarter. We expect  this figure to increase further in the coming quarters. Both the blended ARPU (smartphone and mobile broadband  services) and smartphone services ARPU saw a small increase in the third quarter, while churn decreased slightly,  reflecting an overall solid quarterly performance from our Norwegian operation.      One of the highlights of the quarter was the agreement to acquire a B2C customer base from Norwegian mobile  phone operator Hello for approximately NOK 75 million, and by the end of October, the migration process had been  successfully concluded. More than 40 thousand customers were moved across from Hello to ice.net, in line with our  ambitions for the acquisition. We will see the full effect from this acquisition from 2018 onwards.     In September, ice.net also signed an important deal with the Norwegian police, who will use ice.net as a secondary  supplier to deliver mobile broadband to the police for a period of up to 5 years. In October, ice.net also signed a  contract with NSB Passenger train to provide mobile broadband services to its 185 trains.      Towards the end of the quarter, ice group Scandinavia further increased its financial flexibility when it successfully  placed a new four-year NOK 1,4 billion senior secured bond issue. The bonds will have a coupon of 3 months NIBOR  +4.60% and will be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The new bond is a refinancing of the outstanding committed  secured facilities of NOK 1,4 billion, where NOK 800 million was outstanding and NOK 600 million undrawn.    A key priority for ice group is to continue to invest in network infrastructure and technology. At the end of September,  ice.net and Nokia successfully demonstrated a current hardware solution that provides 3 gigabit download speed  (equivalent to 4.9G) at a media event in Norway. Ice.net’s network is future-ready for both 4.5G and VoLTE, which is  something the Group will aim to capitalise on in the coming decade.    Subsequent to the quarter, on 16 November 2017, ice.net was elected “mobile phone operator of the year” at Inside  Telecom’s annual conference as a recognition of the company’s progress in 2016 and 2017.        2017 2016 2017 2016 Service revenue 335,728 230,836 914,676 605,680 EBITDA * -139,192 -71,120 -351,919 -158,444 CAPEX ** -90,924 -90,316 -501,067 -323,776 Total assets 2,978,524 2,739,039 2,978,524 2,739,039 Operating margin % nm nm nm nm Equity/assets ratio % 26% 31% 26% 31% NOK thousands ** CAPEX is defined as investments in non-current assets as reported in the statement of cash flows. * ice group defines EBITDA as operating profit after adjustment of operating expenses for depreciation, amortization and impairment  losses, foreign exchange differences recognized in income pertaining to revaluation of items in the balance sheet and non- recurring items.

Third Quarter Jan - Sep THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2017                2  Significant events during the period    ⁎ On 11 July 2017, ice group’s Norwegian network operator ice.net entered into and closed an agreement to  acquire a B2C customer base from Norwegian mobile phone operator Hello. Following the forthcoming  migration process, ice.net will expect to have acquired more than (net) 40,000 B2C customers. Ice.net will  pay approximately NOK 75 million for the customer base, plus a potential bonus payment dependent on  number of subscribers successfully migrated to Ice.  ⁎ In August and September, more than 27,000 Hello B2C customers were successfully migrated across to  ice.net in Norway.  ⁎ On 23 August 2017, the AINMT group changed its name and brand to ice group. Subsequently, the legal  entity AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS was re-named ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS.    ⁎ In September, ice.net signed an important deal with the Norwegian police, which will use ice.net as a  secondary supplier to deliver mobile broadband to the police for a period of up to 5 years.    ⁎ On 26 September 2017, ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS successfully placed a new four-year NOK 1,4  billion senior secured bond issue (later issued on 12 October 2017).

Ice Group Scandinavia Holdings AS  JANUARY - SEPTEMBER 2018  Q3 Interim report  THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2018                1 1  THIRD QUARTER 2018 SUMMARY  ⁎ Service revenue of NOK 405,012 thousand; 21% y-o-y growth  ⁎ EBITDA 2) of NOK -64,332 thousand  ⁎ Book equity of NOK 653,949 thousand      1) Service revenue and operating expenses for 2017 have been restated due to commission revenue reclassification. No effect on  EBITDA and net profit. See page 8 for more information.  2) Ice Scandinavia defines EBITDA as operating income after adjustment of expenses for depreciation, amortization, impairment,  network upgrades, share based compensation expense, non-recurring and other non-operational items. Any effects from business  combinations are not included in EBITDA. For details, see Definitions of Key Ratios.  3) CAPEX is defined as investments in non-current assets as reported in the statement of cash flows (including investments in  contract assets).  CEO’s statement  Our service revenues in the third quarter 2018 increased by 21% for the Ice Scandinavia and 30% for Norway compared  with the third quarter last year. EBITDA in the third quarter improved by 35% for Ice Scandinavia and 35% for Norway,  reflecting higher on-net traffic and thereby lower NRA-costs and temporarily lower SAC in the third quarter this year.    In the quarter, the legal restructuring of Ice Scandinavia’s parent companies was successfully completed. A combined  legal restructuring and demerger of its non-Scandinavian businesses has enabled an improved and more transparent  ownership structure for Ice Group and a business strategy with sole focus on Scandinavia. We believe this strategy will  significantly strengthen our ability to become an even stronger challenger to the Norwegian mobile network operator  duopoly. Eivind Helgaker was appointed CEO of Ice Group on 23 August 2018.    As an effect of the smartphone network build-out in Norway reaching 83% in the third quarter, the average smartphone  data on-net traffic share increased to 59% in the third quarter 2018, up from 24% in the same quarter last year and up  from 55% in the second quarter 2018. The average data on-net share for September 2018 alone reached 63%. The  improved data on-net levels allow a larger commercial flexibility with regards to product offerings and enhanced  competitiveness within all customer segments.    Both the smartphone ARPU and the blended ARPU (smartphone and mobile broadband) increased in the third quarter  2018 versus both the corresponding quarter last year and the second quarter 2018, as a consequence of continued  increase in data traffic usage. During the quarter, Ice Scandinavia has launched new, customer-centric market  initiatives that have been well received and are expected to further drive ARPU.    Churn showed a significant reduction in the third quarter 2018 versus the corresponding quarter last year, but increased  somewhat from the second quarter 2018, primarily due to a strategic decision to reduce investments in the retail sales  channel during the third quarter in order to strengthen sales through the company’s own channels.    According to official Nkom statistics, ice in Norway had 7.4% share of the mobile telephony market (based on number  of subscriptions) as of 30 June 2018. Subscriber growth has continued in the third quarter.     Going forward, a key priority is to activate additional plans to further improve Ice Scandinavia’s competitive position in  Scandinavia and continue the accretive network build-out in Norway. The customer centric strategy has proven to be  successful and Ice Scandinavia will continue building on this strategy in seeking to gain further market share in Norway.    2018 2017 2018 2017 Service revenue 1) 405,012 334,125 1,149,012 909,801 EBITDA 2) -64,332 -99,730 -266,609 -271,203 CAPEX 3) -110,897 -160,878 -490,860 -666,533 Total assets 3,465,503 3,257,695 3,465,503 3,257,695 Operating margin % nm nm nm nm Equity/assets ratio % 19% 32% 19% 32% NOK thousands Third Quarter Jan - Sep THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2018                2 2  INTERIM REPORT  Significant events during the period  ⁎ On 21 August 2018, the new board of Ice Group AS was elected, effectively becoming the new operating  board of directors of Ice Group.  ⁎ On 23 August 2018, Ice Group AS – which is now the top parent company of Ice Scandinavia - announced  that all conditions for the de-merger of the group’s non-Scandinavian assets had been successfully met and  was then formally registered in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises on 4 September 2018.  ⁎ On 23 August 2018, the managing director of Ice in Norway, Eivind Helgaker, was appointed CEO also of  Ice Group AS. Helgaker will also continue in his role as managing director of Ice Group’s Norwegian operation,  which represents the large majority of Ice Group’s business.  ⁎ On 19 September 2018 the restructuring of the parent companies of Ice Scandinavia was formally completed  and the share capital increase relating to the issue of shares was registered in the Norwegian Register of  Business Enterprises. All shareholders in AINMT Holding AB accepted to swap their shares in AINMT Holdings  AB with shares in Ice Group AS (the “flip-up”). Following the transaction. Ice Group AS holds 99.8 % of the  issued shares in AINMT Holdings AB. The remaining 5 shareholders in AINMT Holdings AB, that in aggregate  own 0.2 % of the issued shares in the company, have entered into an agreement to swap their shares in  AINMT Holdings AB with shares in Ice Group AS at a later point in time.  ⁎ On 26 September 2018, Ice Group completed the sale of its 30 percent ownership share in in Nextel Holdings  S.à r.l. to AI Media Holdings (NMT) LLC.  Significant events after the end of the period  ⁎ The board of directors of the Company was changed on 15 October 2018. JD Fouchard and Johan Michelsen  left the board, and new board members appointed were Henning Karlsrud (chairman), Eivind Helgaker and  Anders Koch.  Personnel and organization  At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 199 versus 186 for the equivalent period the previous  year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, Ice  Scandinavia employed 289 (277) people.  Investments  Ice Scandinavia’s acquisition of non-current assets during the third quarter amounted to NOK -110,816   (-160,855) thousand. The investments are mainly related to the smartphone network build-out project in Norway, both  on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems and radio access network expansion, and costs to obtain  and fulfil customer contracts.    As from 1 January 2018, pursuant to the adoption of IFRS 15, Ice Scandinavia capitalizes costs to obtain and to fulfil  customer contracts, which means that these items are now recognized as investment expenditures instead of as  operating expenditures as they were previously. As the change of accounting principle is applied retrospectively, the  impact on the third quarter of 2017 investments was NOK -73,490 thousand while this quarter’s investment in new  customers amounted to NOK -34,523 thousand. These are included in the acquisition of non-current assets amounts  above.    Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK -81 (-22) thousands.  EBITDA  Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the third quarter amounted to NOK 15,246 (6,827)  thousands. Non-recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade  and build-out. Please also see the Alternative Performance Measures reconciliation on page 11.    The implementation of the IFRS 15 reporting standard from 1 January 2018 has changed how and when certain  revenue and cost items are recognized, which has an impact on Ice Scandinavia’s EBITDA. The effect from the new  standard on Ice Scandinavia’s EBITDA compared to previously applied principles for the third quarter 2017 amounted  to NOK 39,462 thousand. More information is presented under the New and changed accounting standards in 2018  section on page 9.  THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2018                3 3  Reclassification of commission revenue  Since the purchase of Network Norway business customers in March 2015, commission revenue and related expenses  have been recorded on a gross basis within service revenue and operating expenses, in line with the accounting in  Network Norway prior to being acquired by ice. Ice Scandinavia has decided to change the accounting principle and  instead recognise the commission revenue net of expenses. The accumulated revenue impact for the third quarter  2017 amounted to NOK -9,404 thousand, while the revenue impact for the first nine months amounted to NOK -25,365  thousand. Operating Result and EBITDA are not affected. All comparative numbers have been updated to reflect the  change, for further details see page 8.  Risks and factors of uncertainty  Ice Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings or its financial  position. These can be divided into industry, operational and financial risks, including regulatory and competitive risks.    A material part of the Ice Scandinavia’s revenues and profits is derived from operations outside Norway. Currency  fluctuations may influence the reported figures in NOK. Please refer to the annual report of 2017 for a detailed  description of the risks identified.  Related party transactions  No related party transactions to report for the third quarter of 2018. For other items, see further details under the section  on critical accounting estimates and judgements in the annual report of 2017.  Outlook 2018  Ice Scandinavia expects to increase its mobile phone (smartphone) market share in Norway.  Legal disclaimer  Certain statements in this report are forward-looking and the actual outcomes may be materially different. In addition  to the factors discussed, other factors could have an impact on actual outcomes. Such factors include developments  for customers, competitors, the impact of economic and market conditions, national and international legislation and  regulations, fiscal regulations, fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates and political risks.        15 November 2018    The Board of Directors of Ice Group Scandinavia Holdings AS  THIRD QUARTER RESULTS 2018          4    4  CONDENSED FINANCIAL REPORTS  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME        The accompanying notes are an integral part of the condensed consolidated financial statements.   2018 2017 2) 2018 2017 2) 2017 2) Service revenue 1) 405,012 334,125 1,149,012 909,801 1,265,677 Other operating revenue 35,839 21,354 89,600 47,406 80,290 Total operating revenue 440,851 355,479 1,238,611 957,206 1,345,967 National roaming expenses -108,555 -103,362 -333,092 -270,356 -394,743 Operating expenses 1) -187,390 -139,718 -504,354 -415,626 -569,926 Other expenses -161,219 -170,075 -532,450 -437,704 -624,423 Employee benefit expenses -63,264 -48,880 -160,267 -143,005 -193,778 Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses -80,611 -75,663 -240,258 -223,634 -310,816 Total operating expenses -601,040 -537,699 -1,770,422 -1,490,325 -2,093,687 Operating result -160,189 -182,220 -531,810 -533,119 -747,719 Financial items - net -33,786 -13,567 -131,238 -229,644 -260,470 Share of net profit from joint ventures 75 8 12 -63 -28 Result before tax -193,901 -195,778 -663,036 -762,825 -1,008,218 Income taxes -543 -565 -3,119 -4,368 -6,448 Net result for the period -194,445 -196,343 -666,154 -767,193 -1,014,666 Translation differences on foreign operations 742 -986 -4,039 2,005 3,696 Change in market value of derivative instruments - -2,711 - -2,711 - Tax effect on derivative instruments - 651 - 651 - Other comprehensive income 742 -3,046 -4,039 -55 3,696 Total comprehensive income for the period -193,703 -199,389 -670,193 -767,250 -1,010,969 Net result for the period attributable to: Equity holders of the Parent Company -194,445 -196,159 -666,154 -766,392 -1,013,698 Non-controlling interests - -184 - -802 -968 Net result for the period -194,445 -196,343 -666,154 -767,193 -1,014,666 Total comprehensive income attributable to: Parent Company shareholders -193,703 -199,212 -670,712 -766,455 -1,010,002 Non-controlling interests - -177 519 -794 -971 Total comprehensive income for the period -193,703 -199,389 -670,193 -767,250 -1,010,969 Full year Items that may be subsequently reclassified to profit loss: NOK thousands Third Quarter 1)  Service revenue and operating expenses for 2017 have been restated due to commission revenue  reclassification.

RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT Q3/2013 Q3 RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT Q3 2013 TuRNOvER gREw 11.9 PER cENT bETwEEN JANuARy ANd SEPTEMbER 2013 July-September 2013 in brief Group turnover was MEUR 16.7 (MEUR 16.5),  growth of 1.1 per cent. EBITDA was MEUR 2.9 (MEUR 3.3),  decrease of 11.8 per cent. Operating profit was MEUR 1.6 (MEUR 2.2),  decrease of 26.9 per cent. January-September 2013 in brief Group turnover was MEUR 47.1 (MEUR 42.1),  growth of 11.9 per cent. EBITDA was MEUR 5.8 (MEUR 6.3),  decrease of 8.2 per cent. Operating profit was MEUR 2.0 (MEUR 3.3),  decrease of 38.4 per cent. Prospects for 2013 Restamax estimates that the 2013 turnover would  grow approximately 10 per cent from the previous  year. This growth was fuelled by the investments  made in 2012. The 2012 turnover was MEUR 60.8.  The company estimated that the EBITDA for 2013  would remain at the same level as during the  previous year. The 2012 EBITDA was MEUR 9.9. The nine first months of 2013 have been an  extremely interesting time for Restamax. During  this time, we have launched preparations that  aim at taking the company to the next level.  Earlier in the autumn, we announced that we  were investigating different strategic options,  one of them being listing on the Helsinki Stock  Exchange. Restamax is a growing company, and  an equity issue and listing on the stock exchange  would enable us to complete our growth strategy  in accordance with our plans. The final decision  regarding the listing will be made during the  autumn. This year our operating environment has been  very challenging, particularly at the beginning  of the year. Over the last years, the Finnish  restaurant business has grown approximately  3-4 per cent, in other words, slightly more  than GDP, but this year the overall turnover of  the restaurant business has been predicted to  remain at last year’s level. Several long-term  development trends are behind the historic  growth of the restaurant business, including for  example urbanisation, the growth in the number  of single-resident households, the changing  consumer habits and the increase in tourism and  domestic travel. Dining out is steadily increasing  in Finland, but in this respect we still fall behind  the European standard.  The Restamax operational model is based on a  concept approach with effective administration  and operational government in the background.  Our operational model aims at providing various  restaurant concepts in a flexible way to meet  local demand and suit the available premises  while retaining the unique personality of each  establishment. An operating model that adapts  to demand gives us a large target market and the  prerequisites to expand both into new fields and  locally in the cities in which we already operate.  MANAgINg dIREcTOR MARkku vIRTANEN: continues on next page Q3 The basis of our growth is in active product  development and innovation, competent staff  and experienced management, operative ac- countability given to each unit and, on the other  hand, real-time guidance and monitoring of  operations. Centralised purchases, governed  staff resources and good logistics are significant  drivers for Restamax’s profitability. In order to  boost our local operations, the company strives  to establish several restaurants and concepts  at each of our locations. This way Restamax can  offer its customers more extensive supply of  services and also boost its local operations in  terms of marketing, purchases and personnel  management, for example. Although the general financial situation in  Finland continued to be unstable and costs  continued to climb, their effects on the  company’s products and their demand were  relatively small. Restamax’s turnover between  1 January and 30 September 2013 was MEUR  47.1, which means it has grown 11.9 per cent in  comparison to the same period last year. The  growth is mostly explained by the restaurant  investments made at the end of 2012, and also  demand was good over the past summer. Our  growth rate has been somewhat slower than  during the previous years, as during this review  period we have been focusing on the listing  project, and have therefore not completed any  significant new investments. We predict our turnover for the entire financial  period will grow approximately 10 per cent from  last year. The last quarter of the year is clearly  the most important, both in terms of sales and  particularly from the viewpoint of making profit.  In 2012, the last quarter’s share of the entire  year’s turnover was 30.7 per cent, of the EBITDA   36.3 per cent and of the total profit 43.0 per cent.  Restamax was able to maintain its profitability  at a good level in comparison to the average level  of the field and despite the challenging general  financial situation. Our EBITDA during the period  1 January - 30 September 2013 was MEUR 5.8,  which means that the EBITDA decreased slightly  from the same period last year. One of the  factors explaining the decrease of the EBITDA  is the failed theatre restaurant concept we  launched in January 2013. Without this launch,  our EBITDA would have been on a par with last  year. In addition, profitability has been slightly  affected by the investments we have made in  preparation for the listing. During the present year, we have opened three  new restaurants and have already decided to  open five more restaurants during the end of  2013 and the beginning of 2014. We have also  renovated three of our existing restaurants and  given them new concepts.  Restamax actively investigates and researches  the possibility of further business acquisitions.  According to our management’s evaluation, the  business transaction market in the restaurant  industry is good. The company is planning to  use a major part of the capital gathered from the  planned stock listing to expand its operations  through business acquisitions that support our  growth strategy. We aim at reaching the goal laid  out by our board: turnover of MEUR 100 by 2015.  We believe that our scaling operational model,  excellent competitive position, profitability in  the current challenging market situation, and  the fragmentation of our industry will allow  us to increase our share of the market through  corporate acquisition and organic growth. continues from previous page Q3  Jul-Sep/13 Jul-Sep/12 Jan-Sep/13 Jan-Sep/12 Jan-Dec/12  Turnover 16,667 16,488 47,086 42,094 60,773   EBITDA 2,931 3,324 5,807 6,328 9,939   EBITDA% 17.6% 20.2% 12.3% 15.0% 16.4%   Operating profit 1,627 2,226 2,010 3,261 5,719   Operating profit % 9.8% 13.5% 4.3% 7.7% 9.4%   Income of the review period 1,121 1,776 1,181 2,056 3,788   For parent company shareholders 1,040 1,452 1,009 1,596 3,076   For minority shareholders 82 323 172 460 712   Earnings per share for parent  company shareholders (EUR) 0.10 0.15 0.09 0.16 0.31   Interest-bearing net liabilities   8,512 8,319 5,982   Gearing ratio   61.6% 69.2% 43.8%   Equity ratio   42.0% 37.1% 38.1%    Jul-Sep/13 Jul-Sep/12 Jan-Sep/13 Jan-Sep/12 Jan-Dec/12  Material margin %   73.3% 73.7% 74.3% Staff expenses % (incl. rented workforce)    31.7% 30.8% 29.6% Return on investment %   11.0% 18.5% 24.2% kEy fIguRES   (TEUR) kEy fIguRES  Q3 The income of the group’s third quarter of 2013 Restamax’s turnover for the third quarter was  MEUR 16.7 (MEUR 16.5), which is slightly more  than last year. The EBITDA was MEUR 2.9 (MEUR  3.3). The group’s profit was MEUR 1.6 (MEUR 2.2).  The group’s income for January-September 2013 Restamax’s turnover for the period of nine  months was MEUR 47.1 (MEUR 42.1), an increase  of 11.9 per cent over last year. The EBITDA was  MEUR 5.8 (MEUR 6.3). The group’s profit was  MEUR 2.0 (MEUR 3.3).

Our growth rate has been somewhat  slower than during the previous years, as during  this review period we have focused on the listing  project, and have therefore not completed any  significant new investments.  Our EBITDA was slightly lower than during  the same period last year. One of the factors  explaining the decrease of the EBITDA is the  failed theatre restaurant concept we launched in  January 2013. Without this launch, our EBITDA  would have been on a par with last year. In  addition, profitability has been slightly affected  by the investments we have made in preparation  for the stock listing. The group’s net cash flow between January and  September was MEUR 0.5 (MEUR 6.0). Restamax has not made any significant corporate  acquisitions or growth investments during the  present financial period, due to its focus on the  stock listing process. The group’s interest-bearing net liabilities at the  end of September were MEUR 8.5 in comparison  to the MEUR 6.0 at the end of 2012. The group’s  net financial expenses between January and  September were MEUR 0.4 (MEUR 0.4).  The equity ratio was 42.0% (31 Dec 2012: 38.1%)  and the gearing 61.6% (31 Dec 2012: 43.8%). Restamax sold its share of the advertising agency  Mainostoimisto Fuel Oy in August. At the same  time, the company made an agreement with the  same advertising agency until 2015. The company extended its operations in Rauma  and opened a night club called Panama Joe  there in August. A game restaurant called Space  Bowling & Billiard was opened in Tampere in  September 2013.  With a contract of sales signed on 27 September  2013, the company purchased the Beefmax  Oy shares of a minority shareholder holding  24.68 per cent of the shares. As a result of this  transaction, Beefmax Oy became a fully-owned  subsidiary of the company. The group subsidiary JVP-Security Oy was sold  with a contract of sale dated 30 September 2013.  In September 2013, the company announced that  it is considering listing in the main listing of  NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Oy. The potential listing  would take place in November 2013.

Profit guidance (since 24/10/2014): Restamax estimates that the 2014 turnover  will increase to MEUR 84.0-90.0. The company  estimates that the 2014 EBITDA will increase to  MEUR 11.5-13.0 and the operating profit to MEUR  5.5-7.0. The company’s goal is to reach a turnover of  MEUR 100 by the end of 2015. Although the com- pany’s financial results this year will be good in  view of the general circumstances, the develop- ment of the company’s results in September has  been substantially weaker than expected, and this  has resulted in a downgrade of the profit guid- ance. Earlier profit guidance (since 5/3/2014): Restamax  estimates that the 2014 turnover will increase to  MEUR 86.0-97.0. The company estimates that the  2014 EBITDA will increase to MEUR 14.5-16.3 and  the operating profit to MEUR 8.7-10.4. Q3 3 Results for September weaker than expected Restamax has been on a path of accelerating  growth throughout its history. The listing that  supports our growth strategy and the related  share issue make possible investments that will  bring us a significant competitive advantage in  the future. A significant amount of these invest- ments will be realised during 2014.  The three quarters of 2014 indicate that our  company will continue to grow even in the cur- rent year, even though the end of the period  under review has not met our expectations. We  are pleased with our results for July-August, but  the results for September have been substantially  weaker than expected. September’s results were affected by the weak  overall financial situation and a decrease in the  purchasing power of consumers and the overall  demand. Clear changes in customer behaviour are  also visible: although the customers visit the res- taurants as before, they are consuming less and  their average purchases are smaller than before. The strong growth of our company has also  caused more non-recurring items than antici- pated. These include consulting fees and asset  transfer taxes, which have amounted to approxi- mately EUR 600,000 for this year. The results are  also burdened by the indirect integration costs of  the new business introduced into the group, and  the opening of several new restaurants. The general increase in the cost level has had  a higher impact on the investments than was  anticipated, and this has affected the operat- ing profit significantly. Labour costs have also  increased due to the new collective labour agree- ment that entered into force at the beginning of  September. As a positive turn in the industry, the tax  deductibility of entertainment expenses will be  reinstated, allowing companies to deduct half  their entertainment expenses from the beginning  of next year. The decision supports the demand  in the travel and restaurant business, promotes  employment and adds to tax revenue. Introducing labour hire operations At the beginning of August, our business ex- panded into a new segment as we began offering  labour hire services as part of our operations. I  look forward to starting and developing the new  business together with our subsidiary Smile Hen- kilöstöpalvelut Oy. I see immense growth poten- tial in the labour hire business, and I believe that,  due to the current financial situation, more and  more companies will be utilising hired labour.  Labour hire operations will make Restamax an  even larger employer. We want to do our part in  providing employment and offering our employ- ees even better opportunities to progress on their  careers and to work towards clear goals. Our com- pany has customers in many cities, which allows  us to offer our employees improved opportunities  for more work in different restaurants. Restaurant portfolio expanded, good profitability maintained Despite the challenging general economic situ- ation, Restamax has been able to maintain good  profitability, clearly above the average profitabil- ity of the field. Today, our group consists of over  80 restaurants from different parts of Finland:  nightclubs, restaurants, pubs and cafés. Dur- ing the period under review, we supplemented  our restaurant portfolio by expanding the Space  Bowling & Billiards gaming restaurant concept  into Pori and opening a Stefan’s Steakhouse res- taurant in Jyväskylä. Although Restamax had to issue a profit warn- ing on 24 October 2014 and lower its earnings  forecast, this year’s financial results will be good  in view of the general economic situation. The  goal is to reach a turnover of MEUR 100 by the end  of 2015. I firmly believe that our goal will be met.

Profit guidance (as of 6 November 2015): Restamax estimates that the Group will reach a  turnover of some MEUR 110 during the 2015 financial  period, and that the EBITDA and operating profit will  increase proportionally compared to the previous  financial period. The previous profit guidance  (as of 20 February 2015): Restamax estimates that the Group will reach a  turnover of over MEUR 100 during the 2015 financial  period, and that the EBITDA and operating profit will  increase proportionally compared to the previous  financial period. RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT Q3/2015 STRONG GROWTH FOR TURNOVER AND PROFITABILITY IN  JANUARY–SEPTEMBER 2015 — COMPANY SPECIFIES ITS PROFIT GUIDANCE Q3 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues from previous page A strong result for January–September In comparison to the January–September period the  previous year, the turnover of our Group increased by  more than 36 per cent, EBITDA by almost 47 per cent  and operating profit by more than 45 per cent. Our  EBITDA percentage and level of turnover have clearly  improved in relation to the corresponding period last  year. Our result in the third quarter of 2015 indicates  strong and powerful growth. We are especially satisfied with our result in July. In  spite of challenging weather conditions, July showed  that brisk domestic tourism and plenty of summer  events got Finns using restaurant services to a  creditable degree, which had a positive effect on our  result. Our company’s broad and diverse restaurant  portfolio from summer restaurants to gaming and  entertainment centres supported our operations in  the late summer, offering consumers a wide choice.  Events also significantly employed our workers on  the labour hire side.  Openings, revamps and active   loyal-customer marketing During the period under review, we opened the  new Escape nightclub in Jyväskylä, the brand new  amusement centre Crazy Golf in Tampere and re- vamped some existing restaurant concepts. I have been very happy with the flexible work of our  staff. The new employees who joined us during the  summer have adapted excellently to our operations  and the integration of new restaurant businesses  into our Group has been very successful. By virtue of the updated and newly-opened restau- rants, we want to provide our loyal customers with  a wide selection of services and added opportunities  for utilising benefits in many locations. Through  our loyal customer system, we are not only creat- ing a diverse range of restaurant experiences for  our customers but are also aiming to commit them  to us. Our Ravintola.fi loyal customer system con- tains dozens of restaurants all over Finland, and our  growing group of loyal customers already has more  than 100,000 members. The loyal customer system  is being constantly developed and, during the review  period, it was updated with a new mobile applica- tion. We believe that the system’s strong role as a  marketing channel will strengthen even more in the  future. Growth and profitability despite   a weak market situation The current year is the fourth consecutive challeng- ing one for the tourism and restaurant sector. The  beginning of 2015, however, was slightly better than  expected for companies in the sector. According to  Statistics Finland, the turnover for the whole tourism  and restaurant industry increased in the January–July  period 2015 by 2.2 per cent in comparison with the  previous year. The turnover of restaurants in particu- lar would seem to be rising slightly with growth of 2.6  per cent. Although the sector’s expectations regarding  economic trends have improved slightly, they still  remain very cautious. According to an economic barometer published in  August 2015 by the Confederation of Finnish Indus- tries (EK), the economic situation for the hospitality  industry is still quite weak, despite the positive early  part of the year. In the first part of the year, consumer  confidence in economic growth was at its highest for  four years, but since then expectations have taken a  downward turn. During the autumn, sales in the sector  are expected to decline slightly, and forecasts are not  expected to change during the rest of the year. Private  consumption is expected to increase historically slowly  in the coming years. According to forecasts by the Finnish Hospitality  Association MaRa, the increase in turnover in 2015 for  restaurants licensed to serve alcohol will be about 1.4  per cent. In 2014, the turnover of restaurants licensed  to serve alcohol increased by 1.2 per cent, and in 2013  Q3 by 1.6 per cent. According to an estimate by MaRa,  during the next five years investments in the tourism  and restaurant business will reach one billion euros,  which indicates strong confidence in the recovery of  the sector. Export is also expected to pick up slightly  over the course of 2015, which is anticipated to boost  domestic demand at the end of the year. In spite of recession and the poor market situation  in the industry, we have increased our turnover and  improved our result clearly more strongly than the  sector’s average level of development.  Legislative changes have a significant   impact on our operations Social discussion and issues raised in the media have  indicated that the Alcohol Act will be amended in  the near future. As a result of the reform, the pre- requisites for Finnish drink and restaurant culture to  become more European will be created. This would  be a significant step both for the restaurant business  and for the entire society. The Government’s abandonment of its plans to cut  Sunday and overtime pay is bad news for our indus- try. If the Government had stuck to its plans, that  would have increased employment in the sector and  would have given the Finnish restaurant culture bet- ter opportunities to develop and diversify. A base for comparison for labour hire The labour hire segment that was integrated into our  Group in the 2014 financial year is gradually begin- ning to become established as part of our operations,  and a base for comparison is beginning to form for  its development and growth. Labour hire is quick- ly becoming an increasingly significant part of our  Group’s operations. As a result of the acquisition of new customers and  the conclusion of new contracts, the number of staff  in the segment is increasing. Through this growth,  the organisation and its management is being re- vamped and reinforced. The business of the labour  hire segment has been dominated by the restaurant  sector, but in the near future growth possibilities will  be seen in many other sectors too. The labour hire sector is strongly developing, and it  offers both employers and employees new kinds of  opportunities for operating. According to the Pri- vate Employment Agencies’ Association HPL, the  overall turnover of the employment agencies’ sector  is growing strongly. The demand for hired labour is  increasing and the volume of part-time employment  in Finland has grown significantly during the last  decades.  The new generations are open to working flexibly in  different companies, units and sectors. Work done  over short periods in different companies springing  up alongside long and permanent working careers  has become an everyday thing. Sitra estimates that  these kind of ‘atypical employment relationships’  are already employing 800,000 Finns, which is about  35 per cent of the national work force. Expectations favourable for the rest of the year Although the general economic and social situations  are setting many challenges for our business, we have  succeeded in growing. At the same time, we have been  able to maintain good profitability, which is clearly  above the average profitability within the industry. Our  earnings per share have also clearly improved. In both the restaurant and labour hire businesses, profit  is focused on the end of the year, so our expectations  until then are favourable.

PROSPECTS FOR 2016 Result management (as of 23 February 2016): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  and profitability to remain on a good level in the 2016  financial year. RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT  1 JANUARY–30 SEPTEMBER 2016 TURNOVER INCREASED BY 16.5 PER CENT  AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVED IN JANUARY–SEPTEMBER 2016 Q3/2016 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues on next page A strong result in the third quarter As expected, the third-quarter result for our Group  was strong. Between January and September 2016,  turnover increased by 16.5 per cent, EBITDA by 22.5  per cent and operating profit by almost 28 per cent  from the corresponding period the previous year. In  spite of unsettled weather conditions in late summer,  the growth in our turnover and increase in profit  were strong. We were able to respond to consumer  demand thanks to a comprehensive range of summer  restaurants and our diverse restaurant portfolio.  Our main market area had many successful summer  events, which not only boosted our summer sales  but also provided plenty of employment for our staff.  According to a seasonal forecast by the Finnish   Hospitality Association (MaRa), the summer was  better than the previous year for festivals. The adaptability and quick reactions of our staff to  changes in demand for sales during the summer  season demonstrated a commendable flexibility  from our employees. According to a forecast by MaRa, in the third quarter  the number of visitors to and increase in sales of  amusement parks suffered from unsettled weather  and smaller average purchases. The results of our  restaurants located at the Linnanmäki and Särkän- niemi amusement parks were, however, good,  although no general increase in sales was evident  at these units. During the period under review, we opened a Georgian  restaurant in Helsinki in cooperation with actor-  presenter Ville Haapasalo. In addition to this, we  also renovated several of our restaurants. The first  Viihdemaailma Ilona Nightclub opened in Seinäjoki  in 2010 underwent complete renovation in September.  In Tampere, two restaurants that have achieved  legendary status, Wanha Posti that has been serving  since 1993 and Henry’s Pub operating since 1997,  were also renovated from floor to ceiling. Mexican  restaurant Cholo in Helsinki was also renovated and  expanded. Partner business – one of the cornerstones  of growth From the perspective of the development of our  restaurant concepts, the role of partners in our  subsidiaries is very important and cooperation with  them is close. The commitment brought by their  ownership and their investments in the planning   and implementation of business ideas and the diver- sification of operations are significant. Each one of  our partners puts a strong and individual mark on   our restaurant business. Restamax’s role on the   other hand is focused on operational management,  financing and expertise in the restaurant business. Examples of the subsidiaries that we operate with  our partners are the Georgian restaurant opened  with Ville Haapasalo, the Mexican restaurant run  with Mehdi Younes, the restaurant business engaged  in with Hans Välimäki, Hernesaaren Ranta and the  nightclub business operated with Seppo Koskinen,  Stefan Richter’s Stefan’s Steakhouse restaurants, the  pubs managed with Louie So, the gaming restaurant  business engaged in with Hannu Lahtinen and the  restaurant business in Rauma operated with Riku  Räsänen. Facelessness is traditionally associated with the  restaurant chains in Finland. Our operations,   however, are not characterised by traditional chain  thinking. Our company has more than 60 different  and unique concepts, and new ones are constantly  being developed to suit different market areas. The  richness of ideas and creativity of our partners com- bined with the support of a large company and solid  management experience create good prerequisites  for successful and high-quality restaurant business.  Without such activity, Finnish restaurant culture  would be considerably more homogeneous.  The owner-operators responsible for managing  our subsidiaries create special added value for our  business. We believe in domestic entrepreneurship  and we also encourage our staff to engage in entre- preneurial activity. For us, growth based on the joint  Q3/2016 venture model together with our subsidiaries is quite  a nice way to grow. In the future, the importance of  partner activity to growth will become increasingly  accentuated. Brighter economic outlook than before The economic prospects for the tourism and restaurant  business that have been gloomy for years are now  looking brighter. According to forecasts by the  Finnish Hospitality Association (MaRa), in the third  quarter of 2016 the turnover of restaurants increased  by 5.8 per cent and by 5.9 per cent over the whole  MaRa sector. In the corresponding period last year,  the increase in the restaurant turnover was about 4  per cent. Food sales are continuing to rise while sales  of alcohol lag behind.  Growth prospects for the restaurant business are  particularly focused on centres of growth and  commerce, and fast food restaurants in the capital  region are expected to create thousands of new jobs  in the coming years. We shall also be taking these  prospects into account in our strategic growth. Companies in the tourism and restaurant sector  describe their economic situation as having slightly  improved. According to a seasonal forecast by MaRa,  almost 70 per cent of companies say that their summer  sales have increased, most of them by 2-4 per cent.  Companies in the sector feel that the economic  situation has improved slightly but still by less than  the average. From now until the end of 2016, the econ- omy is expected to strengthen slightly. Of the compa- nies who replied to MaRa’s seasonal survey, 60 per cent  estimated that the Christmas party period sales will  grow in comparison with the previous year. Accord- ing to an economic review by the Research Institute  of the Finnish Economy (ETLA), Finland’s GDP will  grow by about 1 per cent this year and, in the following  years, growth is expected to strengthen. In addition to modest development in the overall  economy, positive prospects can also be seen from the  beginning of next year when the reform of alcohol   legislation comes into force. The planned reform of  food legislation, which concerns Finnish laws that  are more stringent than EU regulations and their  abolition, will bring relief to the sector and so pos- itively affect the business of food restaurants. I am  still strongly of the opinion that, from a point of  view of the development of the restaurant business,  economic growth and improvement in purchasing  power and employment, the tax concessions offered  by the Competitiveness Pact will be indispensable  next year. Growth in turnover of labour hire continues Between January and September 2016 the growth in  the turnover of the labour hire segment was strong.  Compared to the previous year, turnover increased  by almost 46 per cent, EBITDA by almost 35 per cent  and operating profit by almost 39 per cent. This year, labour hire has been introduced to new  sectors and the acquisition of new customers has  been active. For example, the purchase of a majority  shareholding in Seinäjoki-based Make My Solutions  Oy, which took place in the previous quarter, has   created the opportunity to increase business in the  fields of industry, construction and logistics. During  the quarter under review, opportunities for geographical  expansion have been studied in these fields. In order  to support the growth of Smile Doctors Oy and the  health care side, the organisation has been strength- ened through management recruitment. The integra- tion of new sectors and companies into the business   is partially incomplete, which affected the result of  the segment in the period under review.  Strong growth in the employment agencies’ sector  Finland continues. The overall market value of the  Continues from previous page Q3/2016 sector is about €1.5 billion and total turnover in 2015  was more than €1 billion. Total turnover for the  employment agencies’ sector in August 2016 in- creased by about 22% over the previous year and  turnover for labour hire services by 14%. The value of  the cumulative turnover of the labour hire business  between January and August 2016 was €546.66 million,  an increase of about 13% over the previous year. Our growth is substantially stronger than that of  the sector. Labour hire has established a position in  the present labour market and the sector is a signif- icant employer. Strong seasonal fluctuations, diffi- cult-to-forecast future prospects and an increasing  need for labour in growth sectors are driving the  growth in labour hire. Labour hire companies offer  many young people their first experience of working  life and make the challenging employment situation  easier for them. Labour hire is also clearly seen as a  growth area of the future. Market confidence increasing – share price at   an all-time high The target set by our company’s Board of Directors to  expand the restaurant business abroad in the strategy  period 2016-2018 is at the market survey stage. At  the same time, we will also grow our business in the  domestic market and try to take it into new market  areas between now and the end of the year. The growth in our turnover and our better-than-  average profitability are considerably stronger than  the general level for the market. In October, our  share price climbed to an all-time high and, for the  first time, we exceeded a valuation of €100 million.  The rise in our share price shows that market confi- dence in our business has strengthened, and this is  also shown by our result. I am very happy about this  trend and I believe that development will continue   in the same vein. The generation of profit towards the end of the year  is typical of the restaurant and labour hire sectors.   As a result of general market development, consumer  behaviour and the growth in and diversification of  our operations, expectations for the end of the year  and the Christmas party period are favourable.

Operating profit was MEUR 3.0 (MEUR 1.1),  growth of 189.2 per cent. Figures in parentheses refer to the same period last  year, unless otherwise stated. PROSPECTS FOR 2017 Profit guidance (as of 8 August 2017): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  by approximately 30 per cent from the previous year  to approximately MEUR 170 in the 2017 financial  period. Profitability is estimated to remain at a good  level in 2017. The Company’s long-term strategic goal is to reach a  turnover of MEUR 180 by the end of 2018. The Com- pany will specify its target turnover and publish a  new long-term target by the end of 2017. Q3/2017 Continues on next page On the road of strong growth despite a challenging  summer Between January and September 2017, the turnover  of the entire Group increased by 37.3 per cent, EBIT- DA by 8.9 per cent and operating profit by 17.5 per  cent from last year. For our labour hire operations,  the review period ended was a time of strong growth.  The rainy and cold summer brought challenges for  our restaurant operations and especially terrace  and beverage sales in July and August. The share of  seasonal restaurants in our restaurant portfolio has  increased, which is why the lack of hot days had a  major impact on our third quarter, reducing volume  and EBITDA margin. In spite of this, we were able to  keep the most important key figures for efficiency,  such as material margin and personnel costs, at a  good level. This year, our Group has in three quarters  achieved the turnover level of the entire previous  year. Similarly, our earnings per share are increasing:  in the third quarter, growth was 10.5 per cent on the  previous year. Usually, the share of the last quarter of the year has  been extremely important in our company’s restau- rant business operations, but also somewhat in the  labour hire business operations, totalling up to 30  per cent of the Group’s annual EBITDA. The labour  hire business customer base, which has increased,  and the good cumulative figures, as far as the mate- rial margin and personnel costs are concerned, of the  restaurant business operations bring trust into our  ability to make profit in the remaining part of the  year. Restaurant field troubled by unusual summer  weather – outlook still positive According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute,  July was unusually chilly – there has only been one  colder summer in the past 20 years, in 2004. Even  though the average temperature in August was fairly  normal throughout the country, there was twice as  much rainfall. This weakened the EBITDA margin. Although the poor summer weather troubled the  entire restaurant field, the rising national economy  and consumer confidence have helped the economic  situation in the tourism and restaurant industry to  recover, with high hopes for the near future. Accord- ing to the Finnish Hospitality Association MaRa, the  turnover of restaurants increased by 4.3 per cent in  the third quarter of 2017. From the turn of 2015–2016  on, growth in the field has been at a better than aver- age level. The growth in the gross national product is  also a good sign for the increase in the use of restau- rant services. New experience-driven concepts for the market Restamax is a very strong operator in its both busi- ness segments and can stand comparison both  domestically and internationally. The foundation of  our operations is at a good level – we plan to continue  to grow in Finland as well as expand our restaurant  business abroad in the near future. As in Finland,  the restaurant field is also fragmented abroad, which  creates growth opportunities for us beyond Finland.    Since I started as the company’s CEO in September,  one of the first observations I made was the strong  entrepreneur-driven culture. We will also encourage  our staff to think in an entrepreneur-driven fashion  in future. This will result in us being able to offer our  customers new restaurant experiences on a regular  basis in the form of unique service and experience.  Our choice as the restaurant services provider for the  Central Deck and Arena planned for Tampere is yet  another indication of our great expertise and a show  of confidence in our operations. In future even more than before, we will invest in lo- cal market knowledge and in being able to constantly  enrich restaurant culture through high-quality  concepts, services and experiences. We will bring  to new cities our existing concepts and entirely new  ones. In addition, I am of the opinion that my career  in the brewery industry and my experience in inter- national business and sales management enhance  our chances to do well in competition in Finland and  internationally. The most important season of the year is about to  start. Our strong portfolio of various restaurant  CEO JUHA HELMINEN Q3/2017 Continues from previous page concepts offers a range of possibilities to bring feast  amidst everyday life. Our knowledgeable staff, in- creased service and sales orientation and our strong  business knowhow all play a key role in making profit  during a crucial season. Furthermore, we will once  again create more growth; during the last quarter of  the year, we will open over ten new restaurants. We  will expand our markets to Vaasa and Rovaniemi, for  example, as well as further strengthen our position  in Tampere, Helsinki and the northern ski resorts. By  the end of the year, we will have approximately 140  restaurants, in contrast to the figure of slightly over  100 at the end of 2016. Strong growth quarter in labour hire Our subsidiary Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut had a strong  third quarter. Between January and September 2017,  its turnover increased by over 100 per cent, EBITDA  by 90 per cent and operating profit by almost 190 per  cent. The growth was significantly stronger than the  general development in the field, and the profitabil- ity was exceptional for the field (EBITDA in July–  September was 10.3 per cent). Smile’s corporate acquisitions this year have be- gun to reflect positively on our business operations.  We have achieved a new level as a labour hire ser- vice provider, and the entry of new companies has  improved our position in industry, construction and  logistics segments, in particular. In addition to the  corporate acquisitions, organic growth has also been  strong – the labour needs of our current customers  are increasingly comprehensive, and we have been  successful in acquiring new customers. We believe  that the strong growth will accelerate further and,  in the near future, Smile will rise to the ranks of the  largest companies in the field. The cornerstones of Smile’s success are expertise of  various fields and a diverse growth strategy. The geo- graphical network of service locations of the labour  hire segment already covers almost all of Finland,  and we employ over 8,000 people per month in a  responsible manner. Smile is developing the entire  field and does its part to help solve the labour short- age and unemployment. A good example of this is  Smile Education Oy, which was established in Sep- tember. It provides joint and apprenticeship training  and collaborates with several educational institu- tions. Smile Education brings together the needs of  our customer companies, training programmes and  job-seekers. Positive winds of change are blowing in the labour  hire segment, and the popularity of the field is  strongly increasing. The rise of the Finnish economy  also promotes the growth of the labour hire field,  since labour availability is hard pressed. For exam- ple, the country’s growth centres are full of large  construction sites suffering from a major labour  shortage. There is a clear cultural shift discernible  in the job market as employees expect employers  to be more flexible with their changing work needs.  In this, we see a great opportunity for labour hire  operators and even a responsibility to adjust to these  needs. Strong strategy creates a foundation for future  growth Now and in the future, we want to ensure controlled  business growth and good profitability in Finland and  in the international market. We will publish our new  strategic long-term objectives before the end of the  year.

The  restaurant segment is expected to reach a turnover of  over MEUR 200, and in labour hire, a turnover of ap- proximately MEUR 125 is expected, the total turnover  being some MEUR 310 after eliminations.  Restamax will further specify its long-term financial  targets during the 2018 financial period. Previous profit guidance (as of 7 August 2018):  In accordance with its strategy, Restamax expects  the Group’s turnover to increase and profitability to  remain at a good level in both segments in the 2018  financial period. The restaurant segment is expected   to reach a turnover of over MEUR 200, and in labour   hire, a turnover of approximately MEUR 110 is ex- pected, the total turnover being some MEUR 300  after eliminations.  Restamax will further specify its long-term financial  targets during the 2018 financial period.  Q3/2018 Continues on next page From a transition phase towards profitable growth In January–September 2018, the Group’s turnover  increased by 71 per cent, EBITDA increased by more  than 44 per cent, and operating profit decreased by  more than 29 per cent in comparison with last year’s  reference period. Restamax is going through a pe- riod of transition that started in the second quarter  of 2018. Strong growth has created challenges for  business, and the integration phase of Royal Ravin- tolat has consumed the company’s resources, which  has also reflected in operative activities. During  the third quarter, the company experienced major  changes while preparing to list its subsidiary Smile  Henkilöstöpalvelut, initiating transformative action  in order to develop the profitability of its core busi- ness, and building a growth platform for international  expansion in the future.  The result of the review period was affected by excep- tionally large non-recurring items, the most impor- tant of which involved the sale or discontinuation  of unprofitable business in the restaurant segment,  front-loaded investments in international business,  integration costs of the Royal Ravintolat acquisition  as well as direct costs resulting from the Smile listing  initiative. Consequently, the company’s result for the  third quarter is weak. In the medium term, however,  we see that the ongoing significant and goal-oriented  transformation efforts constitute a sustainable road  towards profitable growth already during 2019. We are  now going through a significant transformation pro- cess, the aim of which is to lead the company, strong- er than ever, towards an era of profitable growth. This  goal is supported by a new strategy, the preparation of  which is well under way.  Restamax is one of Finland’s fastest-growing listed  companies, and it has experienced strong, steady  growth from the beginning of its history (2006–2017  CAGR +32%). Over this time period, it has grown from  a company with MEUR 8 turnover into a Group whose  estimated turnover will be more than MEUR 300 this  year, while becoming Finland’s largest company in  the restaurant industry and one of the largest opera- tors in the labour hire field. The company’s strong  market position and size have brought about long- term competitive and scale advantages in terms of  procurement, HR management, management and  administration as well as the development of back- end systems. The necessary non-recurring items and  reorganisation measures entailed in the transforma- tion will take place over the latter half of 2018 and  will start to show results during 2019. In this context,  the company will specify its own goals and operating  models ranging from EBITDA-oriented business to  relative profitability, which will be measured by the  operating profit percentage starting from 2019. The company’s strategy of profitable growth divides  into two categories. In the short term, the objective is  to return the company’s profitability to a historically  good level after a phase of strong growth. Simulta- neously in the long term, the company’s strategy  of profitable growth is based on developing organic  growth and creating new profitable growth platforms. The short term (2018–2019) profitability programmes  consist of 1) Royal Ravintolat integration, 2) Portfo- lio restructuring, and 3) the Core business develop- ment programme. In the long term, the key profit- able growth programmes are 1) Investing in sales and  marketing, 2) Selected big and profitable new projects,  and 3) Building an international growth platform. Aiming to achieve synergy benefits of at least  MEUR 6 The first short-term profitability programme, inte- grating Royal Ravintolat into the Group, has proceed- ed as planned. The key business metrics of customer  satisfaction, personnel satisfaction and EBITDA have  remained at a good level in restaurant units in the  midst of change. The company’s integration into the  Group is expected to bring about synergy benefits of at  least MEUR 6 by the end of 2019. CEO AKU VIKSTRÖM Q3/2018 Continues from previous page Synergies are estimated to mainly comprise three  areas: consolidating management and administration  (synergy value MEUR +1), the purchase and procure- ment synergy benefits entailed in the new company’s  volume (synergy value MEUR +1.5), and the introduc- tion of a new, more flexible staffing structure (synergy  value MEUR +3.5). The last item mentioned above  has required updates to the work contract structure  in restaurant operations, enabling units to meet the  fluctuation of demand more effectively by increasing  workforce during peak periods and, similarly, reducing  staff during quiet weekdays and periods. This change  was implemented together with the staff in compli- ance with the cooperation procedure, and the nego- tiations will result in the reduction of 200 positions  and in the shifting to part-time work of 40 positions.  The arrangements apply to both clerical and regular  employees.The results of the cooperation negotiations  were announced on 5 November 2018. More profitable portfolio through restructuring The second short-term profitability programme fo- cuses on restructuring the company’s unit portfolio.  Strong growth, the acquisition of Royal Ravintolat in  the biggest market in Helsinki and a strategy of prof- itable growth have enabled a critical inspection of the  unit portfolio in terms of profitability. Units whose  profitability does not meet the company’s target level  or whose circumstances are not considered adequate  in terms of their lease agreement and concept have  been sold or discontinued. These units include the  restaurants Enso and Hieta in Helsinki, the Colorado  restaurants in Tampere and at Hernesaaren Ranta in  Helsinki, and Bella Roma in Tampere. Non-recurring items with related write-offs result- ing from the restructuring measures encumbered the  third quarter result by more than MEUR 3. The write- offs have no cash flow implications. The restructur- ing of the restaurant portfolio will be carried out in a  committed fashion during this year’s third and fourth  quarters to ensure that the company’s focus, both in  terms of financial and staffing resources, can be fully  shifted towards developing the profitable growth of  core business starting from 2019. The biggest write- offs took place during the third quarter, and the pro- gramme will be completed during 2018.  Focus on developing core business The third short-term profitability programme is re- lated to developing the company’s core business. Our  portfolio includes more than 200 restaurants across  four business lines: food restaurants, fast casual res- taurants, nightclubs and entertainment restaurants as  well as restaurants operating abroad. Restamax has a  strong market position in Finland’s key growth cen- tres and value-based market segments. The company  has started redesigning concepts for approximately  ten restaurants, aiming to strengthen the restaurants’  business ideas and put them back on the path of prof- itable growth during 2019.  By redesigning the concepts, we are utilising our  significant competitive advantage by forming subsidi- aries with long-term restaurant entrepreneurs. We  consider the entrepreneurship-based operating model  an effective one and an important part of developing  our business. One of the cornerstones of our business  involves our partners’ strong commitment to devel- oping and marketing the concepts and operating the  daily restaurant business while having the support of  a large company, increasing the purchase volume and  utilising their solid financial know-how. Sales and marketing operations as accelerators of  organic growth The first long-term profitable growth programme is  related to developing the sales and marketing op- erations of the Group in order to accelerate organic  growth. Restamax’s business operations have been  developed extensively over the course of the third  quarter of 2018. We have started centralising the sales  service operations of Tampere and Helsinki to Helsin- ki and are aiming to consolidate the operations by the  end of 2018. Centralisation enhances the efficiency  of the organisation’s cross sales, improves customer  service and creates cost savings. In the meantime, we  have increased the sales organisation’s key customer  services both for contractual customers and the ac- quisition of new customers. The aim is to increase the  number of profitable customers and purchases and  improve the customer experience, which is facilitated  by our extensive restaurant portfolio. Continues on next page
