Aksjene tegnes av Pareto  Securities AS på vegne og for regning av de  investorene som har tegnet seg og fått  allokert aksjer i bookbuilding-prosessen, og i  henhold til bestillingsavtale som disse  investorene har inngått. Aksjeeierens  fortrinnsrett etter aksjeloven § 10-4 fravikes,  jf. § 10-5.  2) The new shares shall be subscribed for on the  day of the general meeting. The shares are  subscribed for by Pareto Securities AS on  behalf and for the account of the investors  who have subscribed for and been allocated  shares in the bookbuilding process, and in  accordance with the application agreements  executed by these investors. The shareholders’  pre-emption rights pursuant to section 10-4 of  the Norwegian Limited Liability Companies Act  (the “Act”) are waived, cf. section 10-5.  3) Det skal betales NOK 65-70 per aksje, slik at  samlet aksjeinnskudd for aksjene blir NOK  [endelig tegningskurs multiplisert med det  antall aksjer som faktisk utstedes], hvorav  NOK [samlet aksjeinnskudd fratrukket antall  aksjer som faktisk utstedes] utgjør overkurs.  Aksjene tegnes i særskilt tegningsdokument.   3) The subscription price per share is NOK 65-70,  so that the total consideration for the shares  is NOK [final subscription price multiplied by  the number of shares that are actually issued],  of which NOK [total subscribed share capital  less the number of shares that are actually  issued] is share premium. The shares will be  subscribed for on a separate subscription  form.  4) Aksjeinnskuddet skal gjøres opp ved kontant  betaling til emisjonskonto i navnet til Pareto  Securities AS innen 22. juni 2016 og kan ikke  disponeres av selskapet før kapitalforhøyelsen  er registrert, jf. aksjeloven § 10-13.   4) Settlement for the subscribed share capital is  to be made into a separate bank account in  the name of Pareto Securities AS within 22  June 2016 and the amounts cannot be utilised  by the company prior to registration, cf. the  Act section 10-13.  5) De nye aksjene gir aksjonærrettigheter fra det  tidspunktet kapitalforhøyelsen er registrert i  Foretaksregisteret, herunder rett til utbytte  som vedtas etter registreringen. Fra samme  tidspunkt skal § 4 i vedtektene endres for å  reflektere det antall aksjer som faktisk  utstedes.  5) The new shares will carry shareholder rights  from the time they are registered in the  Norwegian Registry of Business Enterprises.  From the same time, section 4 of the articles  of association shall be amended to reflect the  number of shares that are actually issued.  6) De anslåtte utgiftene til kapitalforhøyelsen er  på NOK 350 000.  6) The estimated expenses in connection with the  share capital increase are NOK 350,000.  Begrunnelsen for forslaget er at selskapet trenger  ytterligere kapital til å finansiere ytterligere vekst i  The background for the proposal is that the  company requires additional capital in order to    #6534568/1  tråd med selskapets og konsernets strategi. For å  realisere denne målsetningen, er det etter styrets  syn nødvendig å tiltrekke seg nye aksjonærer,  hvilket nødvendiggjør å fravike aksjeeiernes  fortrinnsrett. I tillegg har de eksisterende  aksjeeiere som deltar i emisjonen stilt som vilkår  for å tegne seg at fortrinnsretten fravikes.  Tegningskursen er fastsatt etter en bred og grundig  bookbuilding gjennomført av Pareto Securities AS og  DNB Markets, hvilket medvirker til å redusere  utvanningen for aksjeeierne som ikke deltar i  emisjonen. Styret er ikke kjent med gunstigere  måter å dekke selskapets finansieringsbehov og er  av den oppfatning at det er i selskapet beste  interesse å vedta forslaget ovenfor.   Etter styrets oppfatning har det siden siste  balansedag ikke inntruffet forhold av vesentlig  betydning for selskapet.   finance further growth in accordance with the  company’s and the group’s strategy. In order to  realise this goal, it is the board of directors’ view  that it is necessary to attract new shareholders  which necessitates that the shareholders’ pre- emption rights are waived. In addition, the existing  shareholders who are participating in the private  placement have made their subscriptions  conditional upon the pre-emption rights being  waived. The subscription price has been determined  following a broad and thorough bookbuilding  process performed by Pareto Securities AS and DNB  Markets, which helps to reduce the dilution of the  shareholders who are not participating in the  private placement. The board is not aware of  better alternatives in order to meet the company’s  financing needs, and is of the opinion that it is in  the company’s best interests to adopt the above  resolutions.  In the board’s opinion, no events or circumstances  material to the company have occurred since the  date of the company’s last audited balance sheet.

Payment through Euroclear  Sweden AB is estimated to be able to take place on 4 May 2018.    Resolution on principles for the appointment of members of the Nomination Committee (item  13)   Rules governing the composition of the Nomination Committee prior to future Annual General Meetings  applies until further notice.   1. The company is to have a Nomination Committee that comprises members appointed by each of the  four largest shareholders in terms of votes, or shareholder groups in accordance with item 2 below, who  wish to appoint a member. The names of the four members and the names of the shareholders who  appointed them must be published at least six months prior to the Annual General Meeting. The  Nomination Committee’s mandate period extends until such time as a new Nomination Committee has  been appointed. If the members do not agree otherwise, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee is  the member appointed by the largest shareholder in terms of votes, but is not permitted to be a Board  member of Acando. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is co-opted to the Nomination Committee,  if the Chairman is not among the four largest owners in terms of votes.   2. The Nomination Committee is established based on shareholders’ statistics from Euroclear Sweden  AB on the last banking day in September in the year prior to the Annual General Meeting and other  reliable shareholder information received by the company at that time. In assessing who comprises the  four largest shareholders in terms of votes, a group of shareholders is considered to represent one  owner if they (i) are classified as one group of owners in the Euroclear Sweden system or (ii) have made  public and have informed the company in writing that they have concluded a written agreement that,  through coordinated exercise of their voting rights, they have take a long-term joint position with regard  Page 3 of 8  to the company’s administration. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is responsible for notifying the  Nomination Committee’s statutory meeting.   3. In the event that less than two months prior to the Annual General Meeting, one or several  shareholders that have appointed members to the Nomination Committee no longer belong to the four  largest owners in terms of votes, the members appointed by these shareholders must vacate their  positions and the or those shareholders now included among the four largest shareholders in terms of  votes, after contact with the Chairman of the Nomination Committee, will have the right to appoint  members.   Shareholders, who have been added to the four largest owners later than two months prior to the Annual  General Meeting, will, instead of being appointed to the Nomination Committee, have the right to appoint  a person that will be co-opted to the Nomination Committee. Shareholders, who have appointed member  of the Nomination Committee, have the right to discharge this member and appoint a new member of  the Nomination Committee. Changes in the composition of the Nomination Committee must be made  public as soon as any such changes have occurred.   4. The Nomination Committee is to submit proposals regarding the following issues for resolution by the  Annual General Meeting:   (a) proposal regarding the Chairman of the AGM,   (b) proposal regarding the Board of Directors,   (c) proposal regarding the Chairman of the Board,   (d) proposal regarding directors’ fees distributed between the Chairman and other members of the  Board, and remuneration for committee work,   (e) proposal regarding auditors,   (f) proposal regarding the auditors’ fees, and   (g) if appropriate, proposal regarding revision of principles regarding appointing a Nomination  Committee.   5. The Nomination Committee will, in conjunction with its other tasks, fulfill the assignments incumbent  on nomination committees under the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. If required, the company  must also defray any reasonable costs for external consultants that are deemed essential by the  Nomination Committee, to enable the Nomination Committee to discharge its duties.     Proposal to authorise the board to resolve the issue of shares (item 14)    The board proposes that the AGM authorise the board to resolve a new issue of class B shares to the  degree that such issue may take place without the Articles of Association being amended. Furthermore,  the board's utilisation of such authorisation may not imply that the total increase in share capital exceed  10 percent of the registered share capital at the point in time the board should utilise the authorisation  for the first time. Shares may be issued with the condition that new shares may be paid with capital  contributed in kind or by set-off. Accordingly, the authority shall not include the right for the board to  resolve on a new cash issue. The issue may take place with waiver of shareholders' preferential right.  The authorisation may be utilised upon one or several occasions up until the next AGM. The issue price  shall correspond to the share's appraised market value.  The reason for shareholders' preferential rights being able to be waived is to enable the Company to  issue shares in conjunction with the acquisition of companies or business activities. In connection with  such acquisitions, the board of directors is, however, not entitled to combine the authorisation under this  item 14 with the authorisation under item 15 regarding transfer of own shares of class B in such way  that the total number of shares of class B that is paid in connection with acquisitions made through  issues in kind exceeds 10 percent of the registered share capital.    For resolution according to the board’s proposal according to this item 14 requires that the resolution is  supported by shareholders with at least two thirds of both the given votes as the shares represented at  the AGM.    Proposal to authorise the board to resolve the repurchase and transfer of own shares (item 15)    The board proposes that the AGM authorise the board, up until the next AGM, on one or several  occasions, to resolve the acquisition and the transfer of own class B shares with waiver of shareholders'  preferential rights. Acquisitions may be made only through Nasdaq Stockholm within at each time  prevailing share price interval (meaning the interval between the highest bid price and ask price), and  the number of shares acquired must not be so great that the Company's holding of its own shares  exceeds 10 percent of all shares in the Company.    Acquisitions may only take place to the degree that they are justifiable in light of the Swedish Companies  Act's prudence concept. Transfers may be made as payment of all or part of the purchase consideration  upon the acquisition of companies or business activities, upon which the consideration shall correspond  to the share's estimated market value. In the latter case, payment may be made through capital  Page 4 of 8  contributed in kind, in the form of shares or business property, or through a set-off against claims against  the company. Transfers may not be made through Nasdaq Stockholm.    The reason for the proposal and waiver of shareholders' preferential rights is to provide the board with  the opportunity to adapt the Company's capital structure to its capital requirements and thereby  increase shareholder value, as well as to enable the Company to utilise repurchased shares as  payment in full or in part for the acquisition of companies or business activities. In connection with  such acquisitions, the board of directors is, however, not entitled to combine the authorisation under  this item 15 with the authorisation under item 14 regarding issue of shares of class B in such way that  the total number of shares of class B that is paid in connection with acquisitions made through issues  in kind exceeds 10 percent of the registered share capital. In addition repurchase shall be used for  securing available shares in under item 17 proposed share savings program if introduction of such is  adopted at the AGM.    Acando will not, consequently, trade in its own shares.     For resolution according to the board’s proposal according to this item 15 requires that the resolution is  supported by shareholders with at least two thirds of both the given votes as the shares represented at  the AGM.    Proposal of the board regarding guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives (item 16)    The board of directors proposes that the following guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives  (the managing director and members of Group management) be adopted:    The Company shall offer competitive and market-adapted conditions that enable the Company to recruit  and retain proficient senior executives. Remuneration shall comprise a salary, long-term incentive  programs and pension provisions. The salary shall contain fixed and variable components. The ambition  is that the fixed salary plus 40 percent of the maximum possible variable salary shall constitute a total  salary that is in line with the market when the Group's quantitative financial and operational goals,  established by the board, are achieved.    The following shall also apply:    • The fixed salary shall be revised on 1 January each year.  • The variable salary, which shall be adjusted annually, shall be linked to the Group's results. It  shall be limited to a maximum. The total cost of the variable part for the company management  shall not exceed 100 percent of the fixed salary costs for this group depending goal  achievement.  • The possibility to participate in long-term incentive programs shall be given in accordance  with resolutions adopted by the Company's annual general meetings of shareholders.  • Pensions shall always be premium-based in order to create predictability. For the managing  director, the premium shall represent 35 percent of the fixed salary, and for other Group senior  executives a maximum of 30 percent. In general, the age of retirement shall be 65 years.  • Severance pay and termination pay for senior executives, upon termination by the Company,  may all in all give right to maintained salary during a maximum period of 18 months, less any  income that may be received for other employment or business activities during the final 12  months. Should the managing director resign, a period of notice of termination of six months  shall apply. Should the Company give notice to the managing director, a period of notice of  termination of six months shall apply plus severance pay of 12 monthly salaries less any income  that may be received for other employment or business activities during the final 12 months. The  managing director may resign from his employment at conditions as if the Company had  terminated the employment should an individual shareholder or a formal group of shareholders  obtain more than 50 percent of the voting rights in the Company.    The guidelines shall apply to employment contracts entered into after the AGM, as well as to any  amendments made to existing conditions. The board of directors furthermore proposes that deviations  may be made from the above guidelines should the board deem that special grounds prevail in  individual cases.    Remuneration of the managing director is set out in the annual report under Note 9. (The annual  report 2017 will be published on Acando's website in April.)        Page 5 of 8  Share savings program 2018 (item 17)    Resolution regarding a share savings program, comprising: A. Implementation of a share  savings program in 2018, B. Authorization to resolve to issue Class C shares, C. Authorization  to resolve to repurchase Class C shares, D. Resolution on the transfer of own Class B shares,  and E.  should the AGM not resolve in accordance with item B-D above, entering into an equity  swap agreement with a third party.    The board of directors would like to increase the potential for recruiting and retaining key employees,  and therefore proposes that the AGM approve the implementation of a share savings program 2018 (the  "Program") for senior executives and other key employees within the Acando Group. The Program has  a similar structure to the share savings programs approved by the annual general meetings (“AGMs”)  held in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 (and extra general meeting 2014), 2015, 2016 and  2017.    The board of directors considers that the most cost-effective and flexible method of transferring Class  B Acando shares under the Program is obtained through a directed issue of Class C shares  repurchased since. Class C shares will then be held by the Company and then the appropriate  number of Class C shares, following reclassification into Class B shares, be transferred to participants  in accordance with the program and other outstanding equity incentive plan. This in accordance with  item B.-D. below.    Should the necessary majority not be obtained for this proposal, the board of directors proposes that  the transfer be hedged by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with  item E. below.    A. Implementation of a share savings program    With reference to the above, the board of directors proposes the implementation of a share savings  program based on the main terms and principles stated below.    a)   The Program will cover in total no more than 50 senior executives and other key employees in  the Acando Group based in Sweden and other countries. Participants will, after a qualifying  period of just over three years and assuming an investment of their own in Acando shares, be  given the opportunity to receive allotments of additional Acando shares without consideration,  the number of shares depending partly on the number of Acando shares they have purchased  themselves and partly on whether certain performance conditions have been fulfilled.     b)   The term of the Program is proposed to be three years.    c)   Participation in the Program assumes that the participant, during the period 9 May 2018 – 7  June 2018, acquires and locks into the Program class B Acando shares ("Savings Shares").  The board can, however, in certain cases, allow class B Acando shares acquired before this  period to qualify as Savings Shares, on condition that they are locked into the Program and are  not included in any other current ongoing option or share saving program or similar program.  Dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance conditions linked to Acando's earnings per  share before taxes but after dilution (“EPS”) for the financial years 2018-2020, the participant  shall be entitled, without consideration, to receive an allotment of class B Acando shares  (“Performance Shares”), provided that that conditions for Savings Shares have been met.    d)   The allotment of Performance Shares under the Program will take place within a period of 30  trading days from the day after that on which the Company publishes its interim report for the  second quarter of 2021.    e) A prerequisite for the participant's right to receive Performance Shares is that the participant  continues to be employed within the Acando Group throughout the qualification period until the  day of allotment and that the participant, during this period, has retained the Savings Shares  that have been locked into the Program. The employee shall be able to produce the contract  note for each Savings Share, as proof that the Savings Share was purchased during the period  9 May 2018 – 7 June 2018, or before that date if the board has allowed this in accordance with  the above, and that the employee still owns the Savings Share in question. The allotment of  Performance Shares requires, in addition, that certain performance conditions be fulfilled.    f)    Based on the fulfilment of performance requirements maximum 1,000,000 Performance Shares  of Acando class B shares are allocated.

Page   1          Press release 26 April, 2018    Bulletin from Annual General Meeting in Acando 2018    The following items were resolved at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Acando  AB (publ) held on 26 April, 2018 in Stockholm:      Dividend   The AGM resolved that a dividend of SEK 1.40 per share will be paid, and that the Record Day for the dividend  shall be 30 April 2018. It is expected that disbursement via Euroclear Sweden AB can take place on 4 May 2018.     Adoption of the income statement and the balance sheet, appropriation of the Company’s profits and  discharge from liability for the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director   The Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolved the adoption of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet and the  Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2017. The AGM also resolved the  appropriation of the Company's profits according to the adopted Balance Sheet.   The AGM discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director from liability for year 2017.     Remuneration to the Board of Directors and auditors   The AGM also resolved that the remuneration of external Board Members be set at SEK 2,100,000 of which the  Chairman shall receive SEK 600,000 and the other Members shall each receive SEK 240,000. The Board shall also  dispose of SEK 300,000 to be divided among committee members. The AGM resolved that the remuneration of the  Auditors be in accordance with their agreed invoice.     Board of Directors   The AGM resolved that there will be six Board Members elected by the AGM. The AGM resolved to re-elect Ulf J  Johansson, Lena Eliasson, Magnus Groth, Anders Skarin, Alf Svedulf and Caroline af Ugglas. The AGM resolved  to re-elect Ulf J Johansson as Chairman of the Board.     Auditor  The AGM resolved to elect the auditing firm KPMG as auditor, for the period up until the end of next AGM (2019),  in accordance with recommendation from the board’s Audit committee, which intends to appoint Helena Arvidsson  Älgne Principal Auditor.    Principles for the appointment of members of the Nomination Committee   The AGM resolved to approve principles for the appointment of members of the Nomination Committee according  to the proposal submitted meaning that the Nomination Committee comprises one representative for each of the  four largest shareholders or shareholder groups.     Authorisation of a new share issue   The AGM resolved to authorise the Board to decide on a new issue of class B shares to the degree that such issue  may take place without the Articles of Association being amended. Furthermore, the board's utilisation of such  authorisation may not imply that the total increase in share capital exceed 10 percent of the registered share capital  at the point in time the board should utilise the authorisation for the first time. Shares may be issued with the  condition that new shares may be paid with capital contributed in kind or by set-off. Accordingly, the authority shall  not include the right for the board to resolve on a new cash issue. The issue may take place with waiver of  shareholders' preferential right. The authorisation may be utilised upon one or several occasions up until the next  AGM. The issue price shall correspond to the share's appraised market value. The reason for shareholders'  preferential rights being able to be waived is to enable the Company to issue shares in conjunction with the  acquisition of companies or business activities. In connection with such acquisitions, the board of directors is,  however, not entitled to combine the authorisation with the authorisation regarding transfer of own shares of class  B in such way that the total number of shares of class B that is paid in connection with acquisitions made through  issues in kind exceeds 10 percent of the registered share capital.    Authorisation for the Board of Directors to repurchase and transfer treasury shares   The AGM resolved to authorise the board, up until the next AGM, on one or several occasions, to resolve the  acquisition and the transfer of own class B shares with waiver of shareholders' preferential rights. Acquisitions may  be made only through Nasdaq Stockholm within at each time prevailing share price interval (meaning the interval  between the highest bid price and ask price), and the number of shares acquired must not be so great that the  Company's holding of its own shares exceeds 10 percent of all shares in the Company. Acquisitions may only take  place to the degree that they are justifiable in light of the Swedish Companies Act's prudence concept. Transfers  Page   2    may be made as payment of all or part of the purchase consideration upon the acquisition of companies or business  activities, upon which the consideration shall correspond to the share's estimated market value. In the latter case,  payment may be made through capital contributed in kind, in the form of shares or business property, or through a  set-off against claims against the company. Transfers may not be made through Nasdaq Stockholm. In connection  with such acquisitions, the board of directors is, however, not entitled to combine the authorisation with the  authorisation regarding issue of shares of class B in such way that the total number of shares of class B that is paid  in connection with acquisitions made through issues in kind exceeds 10 percent of the registered share capital.  Guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives   In accordance with the Board’s proposal, the AGM resolved to approve the guidelines for remuneration of senior  executives (the managing director and members of Group management). The following main guidelines were  adopted:  • The Company shall offer competitive and market-adapted conditions that enable the Company to recruit and  retain proficient senior executives.  • Compensation includes salary, long-term incentive programs and pension provisions.  • The salary shall contain fixed and variable components. The ambition is that the fixed salary plus 40 percent  of the maximum possible variable salary shall constitute a total salary that is in line with the market when the  Group's quantitative financial and operational goals, established by the board, are achieved.  • The total cost of the variable part for the company management shall not exceed 100 percent of the fixed  salary costs for this group depending goal achievement.     Share Savings Program 2018  The AGM resolved in accordance with the Board’s proposal for implementation of a share savings program 2018  (”the Program”) for senior executives and other key employees within the Acando Group, authorization to resolve  to issue class C shares and transfer of shares under the share savings program. The Program has a similar structure  to the share savings program approved by the annual general meetings (“AGMs”) held in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,  2012, 2013, 2014 (and extra general meeting 2014), 2015, 2016 and 2017. The board of directors’ main aim is to  use the Program to increase the ability of the Company to recruit and retain key employees, and to create an  individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in the Program which is expected to stimulate  greater interest in the Company's business operations and results, improve motivation, and increase the feeling of  affinity within the Company.

They all  have different approaches to fostering integration and inclusion, but a common goal to scale their solutions to  improve both social and financial inclusion of marginalized people in the Nordic region.   The aim of the accelerator program during the coming four months is to help the entrepreneurs significantly scale  up their activities, primarily by entering one or several Nordic countries outside their origin. Acando will support  and coach the entrepreneurs when it comes to strategy, growth, leadership, digitalization or other questions  depending on their specific needs. Nordea, Oliver Wyman and Vinge are also partners in the Hello Nordics  program.  - Ashoka’s ambition is to create positive systemic change in society.

The board of directors hereby convenes an  extraordinary general meeting in ICE Group AS,  reg.no 915 155 995 (the “Company”), on 22  November 2018 at 10:00 (CET) in the offices of  Advokatfirmaet BAHR AS at Tjuvholmen allé 16  in Oslo, Norway.  Åpning av generalforsamlingen ved Henning  Karlsrud som styret har utpekt til å åpne møtet.  Registrering av fremmøtte finner sted fra kl.  9.45.   Opening of the general meeting by Henning  Karlsrud who the board of directors has  appointed to open the meeting. Registration of  attendance will take place from 09:45 (CET).   Følgende saker foreligger til behandling: The following items are on the agenda:  1 Valg av møteleder og person til å  undertegne protokollen sammen med  møtelederen  1 Appointment of chair of the meeting and  person to sign the minutes together with  the chair  2 Godkjennelse av innkalling og dagsorden 2 Approval of the notice and agenda  3 Omdanning av Selskapet til  allmennaksjeselskap  3 Conversion of the Company into a  Norwegian public limited liability  company  Som et ledd i en pågående prosess mot en  planlagt notering av Selskapets aksjer på Oslo  Børs («Noteringen») foreslår styret at  Selskapet omdannes til et allmennaksjeselskap.  Som Vedlegg 1 følger et notat med en  oppsummering av de vesentligste forskjeller  mellom aksjeselskaper og  allmennaksjeselskaper.  As a step in an ongoing process towards a  contemplated listing of the Company’s shares  on Oslo Børs (the «Listing»), the board of  directors proposes that the Company is  converted into a Norwegian public limited  liability company. Enclosed as Appendix 1 is a  memo which summarises the main differences  between a Norwegian private limited liability  company and a Norwegian public limited  liability company.  Sakkyndig redegjørelse i henhold til  allmennaksjeloven § 2-6 er vedlagt innkallingen  The expert statement in accordance with  section 2-6 of the Norwegian Public Limited       som Vedlegg 2.  Liability Companies Act is enclosed as Appendix  2.   Styret foreslår at generalforsamlingen fatter  følgende vedtak:    Selskapet omdannes fra et aksjeselskap til et  allmennaksjeselskap. Etter at selskapet er  omdannet til et allmennaksjeselskap, skal det  innby andre enn aksjeeierne og bestemte  navngitte personer til å tegne nye aksjer i  selskapet. Fra det tidspunkt omdanningen er  registrert i Foretaksregisteret, skal § 1 i  vedtektene lyde: «Selskapets foretaksnavn er  ICE Group ASA. Selskapet er et  allmennaksjeselskap.»  The board of directors proposes that the general  meeting adopts the following resolution:    The Company shall be converted into a public  limited liability company. Following the conversion,  the Company shall  invite others than the  shareholders and selected named persons to  subscribe for shares in the Company. When the  conversion is registered in the Norwegian Register  of Business Enterprises, article 1 of the articles of  association shall read: “The company's business  name is ICE Group ASA. The company is a public  limited liability company.”  Gjennomføringen av vedtakene som foreslås  under sak 6 til 10 nedenfor, er betinget av  at  Selskapet blir omdannet til et  allmennaksjeselskap.  The completion of the resolutions proposed  under item 6 to 10 below, is subject to the  Company being converted to a public limited  liability company.  4 Valg av nye styremedlemmer 4 Appointment of new board members  For å tilrettelegge for en styresammensetning  som tilfredsstiller de krav og anbefalinger som  stilles i forbindelse med Noteringen og  omdanningen til allmennaksjeselskap, foreslår  styret at generalforsamlingen fatter følgende  vedtak:  In order to facilitate a board composition that is in  compliance with the requirements and  recommendations that apply in connection with  the Listing and the conversion to a public limited  company, the board of directors proposes that the  general meeting adopts the following resolution:  Guillaume d’Hauteville og Mari Thjømøe velges  som nye styremedlemmer. Selskapets styre  består da av følgende personer:   Guillaume d’Hauteville and Mari Thjømøe are  appointed as new directors of the Company. The  board of directors then consists of the following  persons:  Hans Holger Albrecht (styreleder) (inntil 2020)  Ingvild Myhre (inntil 2020)  Hermann Siegfried Jörg Mohaupt (inntil 2020)   Guillaume d’Hauteville (inntil 2020)   Mari Thjømøe (inntil 2020)  Hans Holger Albrecht (Chairman) (until 2020)  Ingvild Myhre (until 2020)  Hermann Siegfried Jörg Mohaupt (until 2020)  Guillaume d’Hauteville (until 2020)  Mari Thjømøe (until 2020)  5 Fastsettelse av godtgjørelse til  styremedlemmer  5 Determination of remuneration to the  members of the board of directors       Styret har foreslått følgende godtgjørelse til  Selskapets styre for perioden frem til ordinær  generalforsamling 2019:  The board of directors has proposed the following  remuneration to the Company's board of directors  for the period until the Annual General Meeting in  2019:  Det skal betales NOK 600.000 for styreleder og  NOK 400.000 for øvrige styremedlemmer per år,  som skal utbetales månedlig med 1/12.  It shall be paid NOK 600,000 for the Chairman and  NOK 400,000 for other board members per year,  to be paid monthly with 1/12.  6 Vedtektsfesting av valgkomité  6 Nomination committee in the articles of  association  Norsk anbefaling for eierstyring og  selskapsledelse (NUES) anbefaler at  børsnoterte selskaper skal ha en valgkomité, at  valgkomiteens medlemmer velges av  generalforsamlingen, og at valgkomiteen  vedtektsfestes. Styret foreslår at det opprettes  en valgkomité for Selskapet etter at Selskapets  aksjer er notert på Oslo Børs slik at nye  investorer kan delta på stemmegivningen. Det  forutsettes at medlemmer av valgkomiteen  velges senest ved ordinær generalforsamling i  2019.     The Norwegian Corporate Governance Code  recommends that listed companies shall have a  nomination committee, that its members are  elected by the general meeting and that it is laid  down in the company's articles of association that  the company shall have a nomination committee.  The board of directors proposes that a nomination  committee for the Company is established  following the listing of the Company on Oslo Børs  so that new investors may participate in the  voting. It is assumed that members of the  nomination committee will be elected at the latest  at the ordinary general meeting in 2019.   Styret foreslår at generalforsamlingen treffer  følgende vedtak:  The board of directors proposes that the general  meeting resolves the following:  Selskapet skal ha en valgkomité fra det  tidspunkt medlemmer av valgkomiteen er valgt  av Selskapets generalforsamling. Fra samme  tidspunkt trer retningslinjer for valgkomiteen,  som er vedlagt denne innkallingen som Vedlegg  3, og vedtekt § 8 om valgkomite slik det  fremgår av Vedlegg 4, i kraft.  The Company shall have a nomination committee  from the time members of the nomination  committee are elected by the Company's general  meeting. From the same time the instructions for  the nomination committee, which are enclosed to  this notice as Appendix 3, and the Company's  articles of association § 8 as set out in Appendix 4,  shall enter into force.  7 Vedtektsendringer 7 Amendments to the articles of  association  I forbindelse med ovenstående vedtak og for å  gjennomføre nødvendige tilpasninger i  forbindelse med den planlagte Noteringen,  herunder omdanning til allmennaksjeselskap,  foreslår styret at Selskapets eksisterende  vedtekter erstattes i sin helhet av forslaget til  In connection with the above proposed   resolutions and in order to implement required  adjustments related to the contemplated Listing,  including the conversion of the Company into a  public limited liability company, the board of  directors proposes that the Company's current       nye vedtekter som er vedlagt som Vedlegg 4,  likevel slik at § 8 skal tre i kraft når medlemmer  av valgkomiteen er valgt av Selskapets  generalforsamling.  articles of association are replaced in their entirety  with the proposed new articles of association  enclosed hereto as Appendix 4, provided,  however, that § 8 shall enter into force when  members of the nomination committee are  elected by the Company's general meeting.  8 Kapitalforhøyelse i forbindelse med  tilbudet  8 Capital increase in connection with the  offering  I forbindelse med Noteringen planlegger  Selskapet å hente inn opptil NOK 3 milliarder i  bruttoproveny i ny egenkapital ("Tilbudet").  In connection with the Listing, the Company plans  to raise a gross amount of up to NOK 3 billion in  gross proceeds in new equity (the "Offering").  Tilbudet skal gjennomføres i overenstemmelse  med de vilkår som skal fremgå av et prospekt  som skal utarbeides i forbindelse med Tilbudet  og Noteringen ("Prospektet").  The Offering shall be carried out pursuant to the  terms and conditions set out in a prospectus  which shall be prepared in connection with the  Offering and the Listing (the "Prospectus").   Formålet med Tilbudet er å styrke Selskapets  egenkapital og likviditet i samsvar med formål  som vil bli nærmere utdypet i Prospektet, samt  oppnå påkrevet spredning i aksjonærmassen  og antall aksjeeiere i forbindelse med  Noteringen.     Ettersom Selskapets aksjer skal tilbys  allmennheten i Norge (samt andre investorer),  er det nødvendig å fravike aksjeeiernes  fortrinnsrett i henhold til alminnelig  markedspraksis for børsnoteringsprosesser.  The Offering will be carried out for the purpose of  strengthening the Company's equity and cash  position in accordance with purposes that will be  further detailed in the Prospectus, and to ensure  the required free float and number of  shareholders in connection with the Listing.     Because the shares will be offered to the public in  Norway (and other investors), a deviation from the  shareholders' pre-emption right is necessary in  accordance with market practice for initial public  offerings.  For å gi styret den nødvendige fleksibiliteten  ved gjennomføringen av Tilbudet er det  nødvendig at generalforsamlingen beslutter å  vedta et vidt prisintervall per aksje, og et vidt  intervall for det totale antall aksjer som skal  utstedes.     Det er forventet at tegningskursen vil bli  fastsatt av styret på bakgrunn av en  bookbuilding-prosess. Den endelige  tegningskursen per aksje og det endelige antall  aksjer vil bli fastsatt av styret etter utløpet av  bookbuildingperioden for Tilbudet.  In order to provide the board of directors with the  necessary flexibility to carry out and complete the  Offering, it is necessary that the general meeting  resolves a wide range for the subscription price  and a wide range for the total number of shares to  be issued.     It is expected that the subscription price will be  determined by the board of directors on the basis  of a bookbuilding process. The price and number  of shares to be issued will thus be determined by  the board of directors following the expiry of the  bookbuilding period for the Offering.  Nærmere informasjon om Tilbudet vil inntas i More information about the Offering will be       Prospektet som skal publisert på Selskapets og  tilretteleggernes hjemmesider i forbindelse  med Tilbudet før bookbuilding-perioden  starter. Prospektet skal godkjennes av  Finanstilsynet, og vil utgjøre  tegningsgrunnlaget for Tilbudet. Prospektet vil  beskrive de forhold som må tillegges vekt ved  tegningen av nye aksjer i kapitalforhøyelsen.  included in the Prospectus which shall be  published on the Company's and the managers'  websites prior to the start of the bookbuilding  period. The Prospectus shall be approved by the  Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway and will  constitute the basis for subscription of shares in  the Offering. The Prospectus will describe the  circumstances that should be taken into account in  connection with subscription of new shares in the  share capital increase.   På bakgrunn av ovennevnte foreslår styret at  generalforsamlingen treffer følgende vedtak:  Based on the above, the board of directors  proposes that the general meeting makes the  following resolution:  1) I henhold til allmennaksjeloven § 10-1  forhøyes aksjekapitalen med minimum  NOK 13 500 000 og maksimum NOK  270 000 000, ved utstedelse av minimum  15 000 000 og maksimum 300 000 000 nye  aksjer, hver pålydende NOK 0,90, etter  styrets nærmere beslutning.  1) Pursuant to section 10-1 of the Norwegian  Public Limited Liability Companies Act, the  share capital is increased by minimum  NOK 13 500 000 and maximum NOK  270 000 000 by issue of minimum 15 000  000 and maximum 300 000 000 new  shares, each with a nominal value of NOK  0.90, as determined by the board of  directors.  2) Tegningskursen skal være mellom NOK 10  og NOK 200 per aksje, etter styrets  nærmere beslutning.  2) The subscription price shall be between  NOK 10 and NOK 200 per share, as  determined by the board of directors.  3) Aksjeeiernes fortrinnsrett til tegning av  nye aksjer fravikes. Aksjene skal tegnes av  DNB Markets, en del av DNB Bank ASA  ("DNB Markets"), som oppgjørsansvarlig,  på vegne av DNB Markets, UBS Limited,  Carnegie AS og Pareto Securities AS  (samlet «Tilretteleggerne») for videresalg  til investorer som har bestilt og fått  allokert aksjer i tilbudet om kjøp av aksjer i  Selskapet i forbindelse med noteringen av  Selskapets aksjer på Oslo Børs  («Tilbudet»).   3) The shareholders’ pre-emption right is set  aside. The shares shall be subscribed by  DNB Markets, a part of DNB Bank ASA  ("DNB Markets"), as settlement agent, on  behalf of DNB Markets, UBS Limited,  Carnegie AS and Pareto Securities AS  (collectively the “Underwriters”) for resale  to the investors having ordered and been  allocated shares in the offering of the  Company’s shares in connection with the  listing of the Company's shares on Oslo  Børs (the “IPO”).  4) Tegning av aksjer skal skje ved signering  av tegningsformular, på separat  tegningsblankett, senest innen utløpet av  21. desember 2018.   4) The subscription shall be made by signing  a separate subscription form no later than  within the end of 21 December 2018.   5) Tegningsprovenyet skal betales i kontanter  til Selskapets særskilte bankkonto innen kl  14.00 Oslo tid på den andre handelsdagen  med betinget handel i Selskapets aksjer på  Oslo Børs, og ikke senere enn innen  5) The share subscription amount shall be  settled in cash and paid to the Company's  separate bank account within 14:00 CET  on the second day of conditional trading in  the Company’s shares on the Oslo Stock

Risks related to the Group’s operations  • Competition from current market participants, potential new entrants and new products and services, may adversely affect the Group’s performance.  • Failure to maintain and develop robust telecommunication networks could hinder the Group’s financial and operational performance in the future.  • The Group is dependent upon telecommunication licenses to operate its business - failure to secure licenses in the future would have a significant impact on the Group’s ability to continue to deliver its products and  services and subsequently impact the Group’s financial and operational performance.  • The failure or breakdown of key components of the Group’s networks, including hardware and software, may have a material negative effect on the Group’s financial and operational performance. • Database piracy, unauthorized access or other database security breaches could materially adversely impact the Group’s reputation, prompt lawsuits and other actions against the Group and lead to a loss in  subscribers and hinder the Group’s ability to attract new subscribers. • Cyber-attacks, computer virus attacks or acts of terrorism or vandalism could result in equipment failures or disruptions in the Group’s operations. • Any interruptions in the Group’s ability to provide services could seriously harm the Group’s reputation and reduce subscriber confidence, • Ice group depends on demand for mobile data services and the ability to service its customers satisfactorily in order to achieve sufficient ARPU and limited churn • Ice group depends on a limited number of suppliers and vendors to provide equipment and services - the Group may experience future problems related to increased prices or procurement of necessary equipment  and services.  • ice group’s success is largely dependent on its ability to retain its best performing employees and recruit new top talent. It may prove difficult to recruit or retain competent personnel in the future.  • If the Group is unable to maintain the reputation of and value associated with the Group’s brand names, the Group may not be able to successfully retain and attract subscribers. • The Group’s licenses may have limited value upon a bankruptcy.  • New licenses auctioned by the authorities to new or current competitors of the Group may lead to increased competition in the telecommunications market and may have a negative effect on the prices the Group is  able to obtain from its customers and thereby the Group's financial performance.  • The Group may undertake future acquisitions on an opportunistic basis which may increase the Group’s risk profile, distract management and/or increase the Group’s expenses. • The members of the Group are, and may in the future be, involved in disputes and litigation, including with tax authorities, the ultimate outcome of which is uncertain.  3 Summary of risk factors The Group’s financial risks  • The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk. ice group does not hedge its foreign exchange  rate exposure.  • ice group is highly leveraged and uses a large share of its cash flow for payment of liabilities, which  means that ice group’s financial flexibility is limited.  • If the Group cannot generate sufficient cash to meet its debt service obligations or fund its other  business needs, the Group may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of its debt,  obtain additional financing, delay planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or sell assets. • Existing financing agreements include, and future financing agreements may include, financial and  operational covenants, and failure by the Group to meet these may entitle lenders to call for  immediate repayment of amounts outstanding. • The agreement regulating the bond issue completed in April 2017 includes change of control  provisions entitling bondholders to call for pre-payment of the bonds at a price of 101% of par value  plus all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.  • ice group is exposed to interest rate risks in interest bearing current and non-current liabilities  (including the Bond Issue). As the Bonds carry variable interest rates, the relatively high level of debt  results in exposure to interest rate risk.  • Credit risk related to non-payment from the Group’s customers.  • Valuation risks – valuation of assets and liabilities carried out by third party experts may prove to be  wrong.  Regulatory risk  • An assignment of licenses requires governmental approval in Norway and Sweden.  Risks related to the Bonds  • The Issuer may not have sufficient funds to redeem Bonds upon a put option event.  • There will only be a limited trading market for the Bonds and the market may have limited liquidity.  • The market price of the Bonds may be volatile.  • The Bondholders may be subject to restrictions on transfers of the Bonds.  • The transfer of Bonds is subject to restrictions under the securities laws of the United States and  other jurisdictions.  • The terms and conditions of the Bond Agreement will allow for modification of the Bonds or  guarantees, waivers or authorizations of breaches which, in certain circumstances, may be effected  without the consent of Bondholders.  • Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments.  • The Bonds may be subject to optional redemption by the Issuer, which may have a material adverse  effect on the value of the Bonds, and in such circumstances an investor may not be able to reinvest  the redemption proceeds at an equivalent rate of interest.  • The security package may prove to be of limited value upon enforcement.  • The contribution from ICE Norge AS towards servicing the Bond Issue is very limited and may lead to  the Issuer not being able to service the Bond Issue.  4 Executive  summary Risk factors Appendix KPIs &  financials 1 ice group  Scandinavia
