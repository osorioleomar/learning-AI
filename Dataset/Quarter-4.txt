Growth in Sweden was 34 percent, of which  the organic growth in the previous AcandoFrontec represented 20 percent.    Results for the fourth quarter have been significantly marked by a positive trend of  capacity utilisation in Sweden, further to the strengthening of sales efforts in the third  quarter.    Profitability in the acquired Resco operations in Sweden and e-motion has  significantly improved and contributed in the fourth quarter to improved margins.    Good growth can be witnessed for operations outside Sweden. This growth, pro  forma, has been as follows compared with last year:  • Germany, +32 percent.  • Finland, +43 percent.  • The Baltic States and Eastern Europe, +101 percent (through the partly owned  Webmedia).

Adjusted for these non-recurring costs, the operating margin was 8.2% in Sweden and 8.1%  for the Group.   3) e-motion is included as of 1 March and Resco as of 15 March.  4) Resco is included as of 15 March.    Consolidated net sales for the period amounted to SEK 1,116 million (646). The  operating profit was SEK 83m (48), representing an operating margin of 7.4 percent  (7.4). The operating profit reported for Sweden includes non-recurring costs related  to the merger with Resco amounting to SEK 8m.    The net profit after tax for the period amounted to SEK 84 million (54).    The corporate tax reported as a cost in the income statement in the financial year  2006 is zero and is composed of the net of the reversed and capitalised tax  receivable. The Company has deficit deductions amounting to a total of SEK 606  million up to the fiscal year 2006, of which SEK 196 million are deemed to be   YEAR-END REPORT / 2006    6 FEBRUARY 2007            ACANDO AB (publ) 3 (14)  www.acando.com  utilisable during the forthcoming years. Deferred tax of SEK 55 million (28 percent)  calculated on this amount has been taken up as a financial asset in the balance  sheet.

The operating profit was SEK 43m compared with SEK 24m in the same period last  year, resulting in an operating margin of 12.8 percent (11.5). The operating loss in  Finland is related to a specific project for a major client. Good demand in Sweden,  the Baltic States and Eastern Europe has contributed to improved margins in these  regions. The lower margin in Germany is primarily due to the establishment of  operations in Bremen and an expansion in Düsseldorf, which have had a temporary  negative affect on profitability while creating good prerequisites for the new year.    Profit after tax amounted in the fourth quarter to SEK 44 million (30).

A distinct rise was noted in the  second half of September, followed by a stable fourth quarter. Trends in demand in  terms of volume were good in the fourth quarter, with continued good prerequisites  for 2007. Continued pressure on prices could however be felt, leading to limited  potential to raise prices.    Acando entered into an agreement in the fourth quarter with SCA Hygiene Products  AB regarding what is for Acando, a strategic IT project. Acando is introducing SAP's  integration platform with employees from Sweden and Estonia.    The general agreement with AstraZeneca was renewed in December. The  agreement, which will run for five years, implies that Acando and AstraZeneca's  partnership will be strengthened and will now be pursued in both Sweden and Great  Britain.     Germany    The Group's company in Germany obtained many new clients/assignments in the  fourth quarter, and capacity utilisation is good. Offices are located in Hamburg,  Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, as well as Bremen since the end of the year. Operations in  Bremen and Düsseldorf have been expanded. All in all, this situation creates  favourable conditions for the new year.    In order to meet the rise in demand in the market, the German subsidiary has  engaged sub-consultants to a greater degree than previously.    New clients in the fourth quarter include Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and  Horbach/AWD. Major projects with Airbus Spares and Airbus Deutschland were  extended in the fourth quarter. Projects have been started with Air Liquide, Unilever  Deutschland, Vattenfall Europe and Comdirect Bank.     YEAR-END REPORT / 2006    6 FEBRUARY 2007            ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (14)  www.acando.com  Finland    Acando's operations in Finland are entirely dedicated to the SAP market, which  remains stable with a high level of demand. A general agreement has been signed  with the company ISS regarding the delivery of SAP services.    The Baltic States and Eastern Europe (Webmedia)    Demand has been good in Estonia and Lithuania, and the newly started operations  in Serbia and Romania achieved breakeven in the fourth quarter.    FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW  The Group's liquid assets, including current investments, amounted to SEK 136  million (85) as of 31 December 2006. In addition, the Group has an unutilised bank  overdraft facility of SEK 50 million. The equity/assets ratio was 69.2 percent (64.9).    Cash flow from current operations amounted to SEK 21 million (24) for the quarter,  and SEK 39 million (31) for the full year. The negative change in working capital of  SEK 21 million is only momentary.     The Board of Directors has resolved to propose to the Annual General Meeting of  Shareholders the adoption of a share split of 2:1 combined with a mandatory  redemption procedure. The procedure will imply that each share will be divided into  one ordinary share and one redemption share.     The redemption shares will be redeemed for SEK 1.30 per share, representing a  transfer of SEK 100 million to the Company's shareholders.    The background to the Board's proposal of a split and the distribution of a large one- off amount to the shareholders is to adjust the consolidated balance sheet. Acando  is deemed, even after this transfer to the shareholders, to have a stable financial  position that enables the financing and development of Acando's operations.    EMPLOYEES  The average number of employees during the period was 925 (608), and at the end  of the period the number of employees was 1,167 (683). Of these, 721 are employed  in Sweden, 249 in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, 181 in Germany and 16 in  Finland.

Sales in Sweden increased for the year by SEK 106m to SEK 976m. The  operating profit rose in the same period by SEK 19m to SEK 82m, representing an  increase of 30 percent. Growth in profits fell however in the fourth quarter when the  profit amounted to SEK 24m compared with SEK 38m in the same quarter last year.   This is due to a number of factors, such as fewer available working hours which  reduced the profit by SEK 5m, losses in a fixed-price project of SEK 2m, as well as a  non-recurring investment in skills enhancement within the "IT Solutions" area in the  amount of SEK 3m.    Germany  Demand for consultancy services was good both during the year and in the last  quarter. The operating profit for the year was SEK 14m (10), representing an  increase of 40 percent. The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 3.7m  (0.5), representing an improvement of 640 percent. Results for the year were  burdened by a provision for bad debts of nearly SEK 4m and a provision for a fixed- price project of approximately SEK 1m. The operating margin has also been affected  by a licence arrangement of about SEK 9.5m without any margin.    The Baltic States and Eastern Europe via the part-owned company Webmedia  The operating profit was SEK 8.7m (8.8) for the year and SEK 2.3m (6.0) for the  fourth quarter. Profit after tax was SEK 2.8m for the year. Further to the end of the  financial year, Acando has sold all shares in Webmedia. Acando and Webmedia  intend to continue their operating project cooperation.    Other countries  Norway: Acando acquired all shares in the Norwegian company Abeo on 28  September 2007. Sales for the Norwegian operations in the fourth quarter were SEK  33.6m with an operating profit of SEK 5.6m. Demand for consultancy services was  good for both the full-year and the fourth quarter.   YEAR-END REPORT / 2007    6 February 2008            ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (15)  www.acando.com    Finland: The Finnish operations developed very well in the second half-year. The  operating profit for the full-year was SEK 7.3m (0.5) and SEK 3.6m (-1.2) in the  fourth quarter.    Denmark: The newly started operations have burdened the Group's consolidated  profit by approximately SEK 6m. The company showed a small profit in December.  Acando owns 100 percent of these operations as of 1 February 2008.    United Kingdom: Operations started in the first quarter 2007 with 12 employees. The  number of employees has grown by about 80 percent during the year. Operations  broke even for the year.    Operations in Denmark and the UK have undergone a considerable development  phase during the year. Both countries are expected to positively contribute to the  Group's consolidated operating profit in 2008.    FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW  The Group's liquid assets including current investments amounted to SEK 71m (136)  as of 31 December 2007. In addition, the Group has an unutilised bank overdraft  facility of SEK 65m. The equity/assets ratio was 60.0 percent (69.2).    In the second quarter, SEK 101m was paid to the shareholders further to the  compulsory redemption procedure resolved by the Annual General Meeting of  Shareholders in April, and SEK 11m was paid with regard to the compulsory  purchase of the remaining shares in the former Resco AB (now Acando Europe AB).  In September, shares in Webmedia and the Norwegian company Abeo were  acquired for a total amount in cash of SEK 70m. The change in the equity/assets  ratio is primarily due to these two redemption transactions.    Cash flow from current operations for the quarter amounted to SEK 58m (21), and  SEK 101m (39) for the full-year. The principal cause of the negative net financial  items for the Group in the fourth quarter is a capital loss and write-down of loans  related to the divested company "Attribute Webmedia" in Serbia within the  Webmedia Group. Other financial costs concern interest on the convertible  debenture loan and pension liability in the balance sheet.    EMPLOYEES  The average number of employees during the year was 1,299 (925), and at the end  of the year the number of employees was 1,431 (1,167). Of these, 731 (721) are  employed in Sweden, 326 (249) in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe  (Webmedia), 223 (181) in Germany, and 151 (16) in other countries.

Despite this, Acando’s development during the latter part of the  fourth quarter indicated a slow recovery. Utilization figures rose slightly during December within  several business areas, and in a number of geographic markets. Another positive sign was that  the number of started assignments aimed at preparatory studies increased. Towards the end of  the quarter, we also noticed increased demand for smaller projects relating to operations and  strategic IT. We saw, however, a continued strong pressure on prices within the SAP area in  Sweden. In order to counteract this, we continue to focus on projects where Acando can assume  roles close to the business operation and develop new solution components. We also offer  packaged solutions to improve customer benefit in existing SAP installations.  Within the Business Intelligence area, development was very positive during the fourth quarter,  and we have strengthened our position further through increased presence in the banking and  finance sector. The market for Microsoft-based solutions also developed well, and we see an  opportunity to further strengthen our position through focusing on understanding the business  operation in combination with deep application knowledge.  Germany is the one of Acando’s geographic markets that showed the most stable development  during 2009. Through a number of successful comprehensive undertakings, Germany produced  a good operating profit during the fourth quarter. However, we expect that the result will  normalize during next quarter. In Denmark, the integration of March IT, which was acquired in  October, is developing according to plan. The operation in the United Kingdom has continued to  show unsatisfactory development. We have therefore carried out a staff reduction in order to  meet the changed demand situation, and to adapt the skills mix in our offering.   Our strategic aim to increase the proportion of project-based undertakings has turned out to be  successful, and we have signed a number of project-based agreements during the fourth  quarter. We have also signed a further number of new service agreements and we now manage  around one hundred solutions of varying scope.   After the end of the financial year, we have signed an agreement with the Confederation of  Norwegian Enterprise. This project is an excellent example of how we can utilize solution  components, experiences and resources from similar projects within the Acando Group; in this  case from a successful project for the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.  Despite the signs of stabilization on the market, question marks remain surrounding the  continued development of demand. We expect, however, to carry out a considerable net  recruitment of new employees within the Acando Group during 2010, in order to continue  developing with our customers and to strengthen our offering within strategic areas.    YEAR-END REPORT 2009             4 February, 2010                ACANDO AB (publ) 3 (19)  www.acando.com  SIGNFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER  In October, Acando Denmark A/S signed an agreement to acquire all shares in the Danish  consultancy company March IT A/S. Acando thus strengthened its position on the important SAP  market in Denmark, with a further 29 senior consultants. March IT is a leader within mobile  solutions and logistics, which complements Acando's offering outside Denmark as well.  Following a preliminary study during autumn 2009, the occupational pension company Alecta  chose to introduce Acando’s Microsoft-based solution ProfitModeler in order to gain greater  transparency in the follow-up of its product and IT costs. Acando has been responsible for the  introduction and integration of the solution.  In December, Acando AS signed an agreement with Statbygg for the introduction of a service- orientated integration platform based on open source code. This further strengthens Acando’s  position as a leader within delivery of solutions based on open source code to the public sector  in Norway.  NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS    Net sales and operating profit/loss for 2009  Group net sales for 2009 amounted to SEK 1,436m (1,611), a decrease of 11 percent compared  to last year. Including restructuring costs, the operating margin was 4.6 percent (9.4).  Operating profit excluding restructuring costs was SEK 86m (152), a decrease of 43 percent  compared to the corresponding period last year. This corresponds to an operating margin of 6.0  percent (9.4).

Earnings per share after dilution, including restructuring costs,  amounted to SEK 0.80 (2.15), a decrease of 59 percent compared to last year.   The corporation tax reported as a cost in the income statement for 2009 is zero and consists of  the net of losses arising during the period and net reversed and capitalized tax receivables. The  company has unutilized loss carry-forward totalling SEK 415m, of which a considerable part is  deemed to be utilizable over the forthcoming years, and thus have a positive effect on cash flow.  The group accounts for deferred tax of SEK 109m, which has been reported as a financial asset  in the balance sheet. This asset will be reduced in line with the loss carry-forward being utilized.  Net sales and operating profit/loss for the fourth quarter 2009  Net sales for the Group during the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 351m (438), a decrease of  20 percent. Operating profit was SEK 20m (47), a decrease of 57 percent compared to the  corresponding period last year, which corresponds to an operating margin of 5.6 percent (10.8).

     YEAR-END REPORT 2010    Price-sensitive information that has to be reported     to the Financial Supervisory Authority    *No tax expense was charged against earnings in 2009.        1 (18)        YEAR-END REPORT 2010    Fourth quarter – October 1 – December 31, 2010   Net sales SEK 409 m (351)   Operating profit SEK 43 m (20)   Operating margin 10.5 % (5.6 %)   Profit after tax SEK 32 m (20*)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.42 (0.26*)      January 1 – December 31, 2010   Net sales SEK 1,462 m (1,436)   Operating profit SEK 89 m (66). Restructuring costs of   SEK 20 m were charged against earnings in the preceding year.   Operating margin 6.1 % (4.6 %)   Profit after tax SEK 62 m (62*)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.80 SEK (0.80*)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 116 m (105)   The Board of Directors intends to propose that the Annual  General Meeting resolve on a dividend of SEK 0.50 per share,  corresponding to a total of approximately SEK 38 m    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The year ended with a strong fourth quarter and Acando recorded an operating margin in line with the corresponding quarter  of the economically strong year of 2008. It is particularly gratifying to see that we improved profitability in both Sweden and  Germany, our two largest markets, which combined, account for more than three-fourths of the Group’s net sales. The sales  growth for the quarter corresponded to slightly more than 20 percent in local currency. In particular, Finland and the UK  recorded very strong growth with continued favorable profitability. In 2011, we continue our work in progress of focusing on  margin improvement, with the aim of delivering sustainably satisfactory operating profits. This work mainly comprises a  strong focus on sales, and operational resource management and delivery.   The market situation in the Öresund region improved during the quarter, but we did not succeed in capitalizing on this in the  Malmö region and Denmark. The utilization level remains unsatisfactory and intensive work is under way to restructure the  operations to achieve intensified focus on deliveries in profitable competence areas.     Demand is favorable in all competence areas, but we particularly note a rise in demand for Microsoft and SAP-based business  system solutions. We are also continuing to secure management-based delivery contracts, which result in long-term customer  relations, with good opportunities for selling in projects. An area in which we foresee high demand for 2011 is CRM solutions  based on Microsoft, with delivery both through cloud and traditional implementations. In 2010, we built a strong position in  this area in our three largest markets, Sweden, Germany and Norway.  The order status for 2011 is satisfactory. We continue to increase the pace of our recruitment to be able to meet rising  demand. At the same time, the positive economic situation means that there is intense competition for skilled employees. We  are also continuing to develop our subcontractor business.     YEAR-END REPORT 2010             ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (18)  www.acando.com  Market development    In the fourth quarter, demand strengthened in all of the  markets in which Acando operates. In several of the  countries, industries dependent on the economic trend  intensified their pace of investment to address growth.  Accordingly, a number of project initiatives were taken at  the end of the year, with delivery during 2011. The  increased activity indicates a continued favorable market  situation during the first part of 2011.   The average price level remains stable. Despite increased  demand, no general price increase was noted.   Customers and offering  A key component in Acando’s strategy is to continuously  further develop its existing customer base through new  and broader offerings. In 2010, this resulted in a number of  new projects for existing customers. These customers thus  evolved to be included among the very  largest customers  in Sweden, Germany and Norway.       In the Enterprise Architecture competence area, demand  remains strong. In Norway, deliveries increased with  continuous orders via framework agreements in the public  sector and, in Sweden, Acando secured a major assignment  aimed at establishing an architecture framework for a  major international industrial group.      A distinct increase in the level of activity was also noted in  the CRM competence area. In several of the countries,  agreements were signed for projects related to traditional  implementation and also cloud-based delivery models.      Increasing number of projects for the implementation of  business systems were also initiated in the market at the  end of 2010. Acando’s position within Microsoft Dynamics  was further strengthened by several major ongoing and  new project initiatives.    In the SAP area, increased activity was also noted and the  number of inquiries grew. In southern Germany, Acando  broadened its SAP offering in manufacturing and logistics  by adding a new team of experts. With this team,  Acando  doubled its number of employees in Munich. Southern  Germany is a key market for further expansion.    During the fourth quarter, Acando also secured the  following major orders:     In October 2010, Plastal Industri selected Acando as  its partner for the implementation of a global SAP  solution in finance and logistics.     In December 2010, following a procurement process  with Halmstad Municipality, Acando signed a  framework agreement giving several municipalities in  southwestern Sweden the right to place orders for  training and consultant support services focused on  Lean.   In Germany, Hamburg Süd, one of the world’s largest  container shipping companies, chose to use Acando as  its partner for the implementation of new  international websites.     Net sales and profit    October – December 2010  Net sales and operating profit for the fourth quarter of  2010 are presented in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010  amounted to SEK 409 m (351), representing growth of 17  percent. The strengthening of the SEK, mainly in relation  to the EUR, had a negative impact on total growth by  approximately SEK 20 m, corresponding to about 5  percentage points.  SEK m 2010 2009 Change % Change Net sales 409 351 58 17% Operating profit 43 20 23 114% Operating margin 10,5% 5,6% 4,9% October - December  YEAR-END REPORT 2010             ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (18)  www.acando.com  Operating profit amounted to SEK 43 m (20), which is more  than double the profit reported in the fourth quarter of  2009. The operating margin rose to 10.5 percent (5.6).          Profit after tax amounted to SEK 32 m (20). Earnings per  share after dilution were SEK 0.42 (0.26), an increase of  slightly more than 60 percent. When making comparisons,  it should be noted that no tax expense was charged against  earnings in 2009.    January – December 2010  Net sales and operating profit for full-year 2010 are  presented in the following table:      *Operating profit for 2009 included restructuring costs of SEK 20 m.  Consolidated net sales for full-year 2010 amounted to SEK    1,462 m (1,436), up 2 percent. Organic growth in local  currencies was noted in Sweden, Norway, Finland and the  UK. However, the strengthening of the SEK, mainly in  relation to the EUR, had a negative impact on growth of  approximately SEK 50 m, representing about 4 percentage  points.     Operating profit amounted to SEK 89 m (66),  corresponding to an operating margin of 6.1 percent (4.6).      Profit after tax amounted to SEK 62 m (62).  Earnings per  share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.80 SEK (0.80).  When making comparisons, it should be noted that no tax  expense was charged against earnings in 2009.    The Group has unutilized loss carryforwards totaling SEK   373 m. It is expected that it will be possible to utilize most  of these in the next few years, which will give positive  impact on cash flows. The Group recognized deferred tax  of SEK 93 m attributable to loss carryforwards, which was  recognized as a financial asset in the balance sheet. This  asset will decrease in pace with utilization of loss  carryforwards.  In 2009, no tax expense was recognized in the profit and  loss statement as an effect of the period’s current tax  expense, and the net of the reversed and capitalized tax  assets attributable to loss carryforwards totaled the same  amount.     Profit trend per quarter     Net sales and operating profit per quarter for the period  October 2008 through December 2010 are shown in the  following diagram:   Operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs of  SEK 20 m.   Growth in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted  in net sales matching the sales level in the first quarter of  2009.        The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2010  amounted to 10.5 percent, which was in line with the  margin in the economically strong fourth quarter of 2008.  This was despite a utilization rate in the fourth quarter of  2010 that was lower than 2008, which indicates room for  improvement of the operating margin.

Sweden    The market situation in Sweden remained favorable in the  fourth quarter. Demand in all competence areas was  satisfactory, but nonetheless utilization indicates room for  margin improvement. Operating profit for the Stockholm  operation improved in the fourth quarter. Despite an  improved market situation in Malmö, utilization remained  unsatisfactory.           The demand for Management Consulting services  increased during the quarter. A number of new  assignments in such areas as Lean and logistics increased  the utilization and thereby the operating margin.     Acando’s position as the leader in the Microsoft Dynamics  competence area was strengthened at the end of 2010. The  assignments became increasingly large and more  challenging. Experiences from the SAP area were used for  leading more complex implementations for larger  customers.  Increased demand was also noticeable in the SAP area, but  at continued low price levels. Acando had continued  success with its offering of management services in SAP  through a number of new contracts. These assignments  also offer favorable opportunities to secure further project- based business. A continued positive demand situation is  expected during the first half of 2011.    The graph below shows the development of net sales and  the operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period October 2008 through December 2010.       The operating profit in the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs  totaling SEK 20 m and costs totaling SEK 4 m in the second quarter for  isolated changes in personnel composition.    Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 amounted to SEK  231 m (197), corresponding to growth of 17 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 25 m (8), up more than 200 percent. The  operating margin rose by 6.7 percentage points to 11.0  percent (4.3). The utilization, hourly rate and number of  available hours were higher in the fourth quarter of 2010,  while the number of consultants was lower than in the  corresponding period in 2009.     In full-year 2010, sales amounted to SEK 829 m, which  was in line with 2009.  Operating profit increased to SEK 64  m (39) and the margin rose to 7.8 percent (4.8). The  earnings improvement is primarily attributable to an  increased utilization rate since prices were stable.  Operating profit for 2009 was recognized including  restructuring costs of SEK 20 m.     2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 231 197 25 8 11,0% 4,3% Germany 86 86 11 10 12,6% 12,0% Norway 48 41 4 2 7,2% 4,7% Other countries 48 34 3 -3 6,6% -9,3% Group adjustments -4 -7 0 3 - - Total 409 351 43 20 10,5% 5,6% October - December   2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden* 829 823 64 39 7,8% 4,8% Germany 321 362 19 23 5,8% 6,4% Norway 160 154 4 6 2,7% 3,9% Other countries 169 117 2 -4 1,0% -3,8% Group adjustments -17 -20 0 2 - - Total 1 462 1 436 89 66 6,1% 4,6% January - December 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Q4  2008 Q2  2009 Q4  2009 Q2  2010 Q4  2010 Net sales Operating margin SEK m  YEAR-END REPORT 2010             ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (18)  www.acando.com  During 2010, operating profit was charged with additional  costs for two major customer projects. These projects are  now completed and all costs were recognized in 2010.      Overall, operations in Sweden accounted for 56 percent  of the Group’s net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010,  which was in line with the corresponding period in 2009.  Examples of major customers in the period were  AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Swedish Match and Volvo.       Germany    During the quarter, demand improved further in Germany.  Acando had major successes in its competence areas of  Content Management Solutions and Microsoft-based  solutions. In addition, Acando strengthened its position in  the bank and finance sector. Nearly half of the ten largest  customers were included in this sector. In line with the  usual seasonal variations, a favorable operating margin  was recognized in the fourth quarter. During the first  quarter of 2011, a return to historically normal margin  levels is expected.  In January 2011, the company management of Acando  GmbH was strengthened with the appointment of Guido  Ahle as second Managing Director.  The graph below shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for operations in Germany  during the period October 2008 through December 2010:  Net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 86 m, which was in line with the corresponding period  of the preceding year. However, measured in local  currency,  operations posted a growth of approximately 10  percent, which, when translated to SEK, was erased due to  negative currency effects related to the strengthening of  the SEK against the EUR.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  strengthened somewhat to SEK 11 m (10), with an  operating margin of 12.6 percent (12.0).     For full-year 2010, Germany posted net sales of SEK 321  m (362), down 11 percent. In local currency, the decline was  1 percent, meaning that most of the decline was  attributable to negative effects from the SEK’s trend  against the EUR.     Operating profit for 2010, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 19 m (23).     Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, HanseNet and Vattenfall.    Norway      Market conditions in Norway developed strongly during  the fourth quarter. Acando’s operations in Oslo, with their  focus on consulting in Strategic IT, Microsoft and Java,  demonstrated good utilization based on existing  framework agreements.     The Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise was  established as a key customer during the year through a  major CRM project based on Microsoft technology. Acando  has a historically strong position in the public sector in  Norway, while the proportion of private sector projects  increased during the year.

In Germany, former Managing Director Michael  Mörchen left the company and thereby the Group  management. Guido Ahle, who was appointed Deputy  Managing Director of Acando GmbH at the beginning of  2011 assumed the post of Managing Director for operations  in Germany.   Nonrecurring costs attributable to  management changes in Germany amounted to  approximately SEK 3.6 m, which was charged against  earnings for the quarter.     Market development    The same levels of demand continued in the fourth quarter  with the exception of Germany. Continued caution was  noted from customers following the start of 2011, primarily  regarding larger commitments and in the form of shorter  average assignments. A certain degree of inertia was also  noted for Management Consulting services.    Prices have remained stable throughout the period with  the exception of Germany which reported a slight decline.    Customers and offering  Demand remained healthy for CRM solutions based on  Microsoft’s CRM platform in the fourth quarter. Acando  Germany assisted Sutor Bank in Hamburg with the  implementation of Microsoft Dynamics CRM solution, for  which implementation was completed in just two months  through the utilization of the industry template Acando  CRM for banking.     Inquiries from customers regarding streamlining and  rationalization projects continued to increase. In Norway,  on November 1, 2011, Acando signed a two-year  framework agreement with the Norwegian Labour and  Welfare Service (NAV) with an option to extend for a  further two years. The agreement represents a  continuation of the collaboration in the Enterprise  Architecture area that started in 2009 whereby Acando  provided expert competence in Enterprise Architecture to  major government bodies such as NAV, the judicial system,  health and medical care as well as the Norwegian Public  Roads Administration (NPRA). This was part of a  modernization program for the NAV.  In the fourth quarter, in Sweden, Acando signed an  agreement with Kemetyl to develop Kemetyl’s business  system, Microsoft Dynamics AX, and their integration  platform Microsoft BizTalk. The project is being  accomplished through the creation of a platform in  Sweden that will then be rolled out in 2012 in Kemetyl’s  operations in Norway and Denmark. Thereafter, the  installations in the UK and Poland will be upgraded. In  parallel with this, Acando is developing a CRM system  based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Kemetyl.    Net sales and profit    October – December 2011  Net sales and operating profit for the fourth quarter 2011  are shown in the table below:        Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter 2011  amounted to SEK 415 m (409), representing growth of  about 1 percent. Growth excluding currency effects was 2  percent.     Operating profit was SEK 43 m (43), corresponding to an  operating margin of 10.3 percent (10.5).      Excluding nonrecurring costs attributable to  management changes in Germany of SEK 3.6 m, operating  profit amounted to SEK 46 m (43), corresponding to an  operating margin of 11.1 percent (10.5).

Consolidated net sales for 2011 amounted to SEK 1,524 m  (1,462), representing growth of 4 percent, growth  excluding currency effects was 6 percent.     Operating profit totaled SEK 106 m (89) and the  operating margin increased to 6.9 percent (6.1). Excluding  nonrecurring costs in the third quarter attributable to the  disposal of consultancy operations in Denmark of SEK 19  m, operating profit was SEK 125 m (89), which corresponds  to an operating margin of 8.2 percent (6.1).     The improvement in margins was primarily attributable to  increased operating profit in Sweden and Norway.      Profit after tax totaled SEK 69 m (62).  Earnings per share  after dilution amounted to SEK 0.92 (0.80). Excluding  nonrecurring costs in the third quarter attributable to the  disposal of consultancy operations in Denmark, earnings  per share after dilution were SEK 1.18 SEK (0.80).

Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were slightly  higher than the year-earlier period.     The operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was  10.3 percent and after adjustment for costs related to  management changes in Germany of SEK 3.6 m amounted  to  11.1 percent as compared to 10.5 percent for the year- earlier period.

The general level of demand remained  unchanged from the preceding quarter.     Stockholm and Västerås ended the year with healthy  profitability even though earnings were less than expected  for the quarter, which potentially had a high number of  working days, due to the total amount of vacation taken.     IT Consulting operations, both Strategic IT and IT  solutions, reported healthy growth with many assignments  at the commissioning phase and a substantial recruitment  need. Business systems, both SAP and Microsoft Dynamics  based, had a healthy utilization rate with multiple new  assignments through which Acando fortifies its position as  the leading business system supplier. Within the area of  Management Consulting, a certain degree of weakening  and inertia was noted as regards the commissioning of new  assignments at the change of the year.        The graph below shows the development of net sales and  the operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period October 2009 through December 2011:    Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to SEK  247 m (231), corresponding to growth of 7 percent. Growth  was primarily attributable to the increased volume of  subcontractors and raised prices.    Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 32 m (25), up 27 percent. The operating  margin rose by 2.0 percentage points to 13.0 percent (11.0).  The increase in operating profit was principally attributable  to higher average prices during the quarter and increased  project profitability.     All in all, operations in Sweden contributed 59 percent  (56) of consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter 2011.           2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 247 231 32 25 13,0% 11,0% Germany 81 86 1 11 0,8% 12,6% Norway 48 48 5 4 10,2% 7,2% Other countries 40 48 5 3 11,6% 6,6% Group adjustments -1 -4 0 0 - - Total 415 409 43 43 10,3% 10,5% October - December   2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 865 829 88 64 10,2% 7,8% Germany 318 321 15 19 4,7% 5,8% Norway 185 160 13 4 6,8% 2,7% Other countries 167 169 -10 2 -6,0% 1,0% Group adjustments -11 -17 0 0 - - Total 1 524 1 462 106 89 6,9% 6,1% January - December  YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2011              ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (19)  www.acando.com  Germany    Nonrecurring costs pertaining to management changes of  SEK 3.6 m were charged against the fourth quarter.  Despite the weak quarter, earnings for 2011 excluding  nonrecurring costs were in line with 2010.     Healthy growth at a significant number of customers  means that dependency on the major customers was  reduced, and no single customer now accounts for more  than one-third of sales. This provides a broader base for  growth and the opportunity to improve the balance of the  utilization rate between customer segments.     The graph below shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for operations in Germany  during the period October 2009 through December 2011:    Net sales in Germany totaled SEK 81 m (86), a decline of 6  percent. The SEK has strengthened against the EUR and in  local currency negative growth amounted to 1 percent for  the quarter.      Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  was SEK 1 m (11). Operating margin declined to 0.8 percent  (12.6).        Norway    Demand remained healthy in the key competence areas  during the quarter.     Acando’s profile as a major supplier of services in the  public sector was further strengthened through extensions  of existing framework agreements and securing one new  framework agreement.      A number of projects were secured during the latter part  of the quarter based on these agreements and on Acando  Norway’s focus on Microsoft CRM and Sharepoint, which  provides favorable conditions for continued growth in both  the private and public sectors.    The graph below shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from October 2009 through December  2011:  Net sales in the fourth quarter 2011 totaled SEK 48 m (48).   In local currency, growth amounted to approximately 2  percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 5 m (4). The margin rose to 10.2 percent  (7.2), which was attributable to higher utilization rates and  increased project profitability.

Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The Acando Group started the first half of 2012 with a healthy market and a positive trend. During the second half of the year,  there was a clear softening in the market in Sweden, while Acando’s other markets continued with their stable trend. Germany  and Norway, in particular, continued to trend healthily, which underlines a positive effect of our geographic breadth. Germany  posted its best ever results for sales and margins in parallel with Norway posting organic growth of 20 percent with maintained  operating margins.  In 2012, we continued creating the prerequisites for long-term stable growth with increasing operating margins. We have  prioritized three areas that, combined, increase the opportunities for us to attain our long-term growth and profitability targets:   - Expand the customer base in each geographic area in parallel with increasing the number of customers that select several  of Acando’s service areas with the objective of decreasing the dependence on individual customers and services.   - Increase the proportion of assignments and projects with the ability to reuse solutions and lessons learned to create the  preconditions for improving margins.   - Increase the attractiveness of the company as an employer to create enhanced prerequisites for retaining and recruiting the  best consultants and thereby creating the foundation for long-term organic growth.  During the year, we have established ourselves as an outstanding supplier of solutions based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM in  Norway and, thereby, have also created relationships with a number of new private sector customers. In addition, we have  implemented several successful projects, in which our collective ability to deliver proved decisive in taking overall responsibility.  The takeover of responsibility for the SAP environment of Foras, the implementation of SAP at Alma Media, the introduction of  a mobility solution for YIT in Finland and the implementation of Klarna’s business system are all examples of Projects in which  we have utilized skills from several delivery areas in the Group.   Through working with some of the most challenging projects and the most successful customers we have succeeded in  attracting the best consultants. Our responsibility for the modernization program in Norway of the Norwegian Labour and  Welfare Service (NAV), the work performed with Telefonica’s service portal in Germany and project management responsibility  for a number of AstraZeneca’s key projects are just a few examples of the above. During the year, this has led to the company  now comprising 70 more consultants than at the start of the year through successful recruiting and a lower staff turnover.  In a challenging economy, we feel secure with the completeness of our offering, our geographic distribution and the range of  customers. We see many new opportunities when efficiency requirements increase, but at the same time, we recognize the  decision processes and savings requirements facing our customers. We look forward to continuing to build relations with our  customers and delivering clear results in every assignment.    YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (20)  www.acando.com  Significant events    Fourth quarter, 2012  In the fourth quarter a six-year strategic partnership agreement was signed in Norway, whereby Acando is included in a  consortium under Steria and thereby participates in a major public sector modernization program. The agreement means that  Acando assumes key responsibility for IT architecture, but also provides services in Management Consulting and IT Consulting.  This is one of the largest IT contracts in Norway.    Acando has signed a framework agreement with Lantmännen Ekonomisk Förening for the delivery of IT services in general and  system integration in particular. The agreement runs for two years with the possibility of extension.    The Norwegian Association of Authorised Accountants (NARF) signed an agreement with Acando for the procurement and  implementation of a new membership system to manage members and customers. The implementation pertains to Microsoft  Dynamics CRM 2011 and Microsoft Dynamics NAV.    Significant events after the end of the period  Since the end of the period, Acando has signed a framework agreement with a Swedish company that is part of a global retail  group. Under the framework agreement, the group companies have the right to call-off services. The agreement applies for a  three-year period and comprises for Acando’s entire offering in Management Consulting and IT Consulting services in Sweden  and Germany.         Business activities    Market development  The market remained cautious in the fourth quarter. This applied particularly to Acando’s operations in Sweden and Finland,  markets which already weakened in the third quarter. Other markets in which Acando operates have not shown such clear signs  of slowing down, Germany is in line with the preceding quarters and healthy demand continues in Norway.   Decision processes regarding projects continue to be associated with lengthy lead times and decisions are made with clear  delimitations in the form of stepwise decisions and division into stages.    Customers and offering  Strategic IT plays a key role when organizations enhance the efficiency of their IT environments. A substantial need exists in  both the public and the private sector for experience-based implementation support for consolidation and streamlining of IT  environments. This is driven by cost efficiency and by the need to modernize to create enhanced services and customer  experiences.  Demand for these services is increasing and Acando continues to be well placed for healthy growth through a  number of major framework agreements and ongoing projects.    In the Business Systems business area, Acando continues to win new assignments for implementations in the CRM field with  organizations including Catella, the Norweigan Armed Forces Human Resources Centre and the Norwegian Association of  Authorised Accountants (NARF) as new customers. Demand continues in SAP for further development and ongoing  enhancements to previously implemented systems in parallel with a number of major ongoing projects. Demand for SAP-based  business systems remains favorable with initiation of a number of projects under way in several of Acando’s markets.    The market for local IT services is weaker than for other service areas. Acando focuses on project-based deliveries. Favorable  opportunities continue in the public sector, non-profit organizations and certain industrial segments, while the traditional IT  consulting business has softened further.        YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (20)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Fourth quarter October - December 2012  Net sales and operating profit/loss for the fourth quarter 2012 are shown in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter 2012 amounted to SEK 410 m (415). Fourth quarter sales, recalculated at the  preceding year’s exchange rates, were at the same level as the preceding year and growth, adjusted for currency effects, was 0.2  percent for the quarter. The fourth quarter had fewer working days than the year-earlier period, which particularly impacted the  Nordic countries, and growth was adversely impacted by this in the amount of 2.3 percent.     Operating profit was SEK 33 m (43), corresponding to an operating margin of 8.1 percent (10.3). Operations in Germany  continued to post healthy operating margins of over 12 percent for the quarter. The fourth quarter of the year 2011 was charged  with nonrecurring costs of SEK 3.6 m attributable to a change in management in Germany.  Profit after tax totaled SEK 21 m  (32). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.29 (0.44).    Accumulated, January – December 2012  Net sales and operating profit for January 1 to December 31, 2012, are shown in the table below:    Consolidated net sales for 2012 amounted to SEK 1,547 m (1,524). Growth, adjusted for currency effects, was 2.8 percent  excluding the Danish operation, which was divested in 2011. In total, the year had fewer working days than the preceding year  and growth was adversely impacted by this in the amount of 1.1 percent.  In parallel, operational growth was 3.9 percent, of  which 3.7 percent was attributable to organic growth.  Operating profit was SEK 114 m (106), corresponding to an operating margin of 7.4 percent (6.9). Profit after tax totaled SEK 78  m (69).

Each quarter in the table corresponds to earnings for a full  year. Operating profit is recognized before goodwill  amortization, EBITA.   The EBITA margin was 7.4 percent for the last 12-month  period.       Development of operations by geographic market    Introduction  Acando is an IT and management consulting company with approximately 1,100 employees allocated over 18 offices in five  countries. The head office is in Stockholm, Sweden and accounts for 54 percent of operations followed by Germany with 21  percent and Norway with 14 percent. The remaining 11 percent is accounted for by operations in Finland and the UK, which are  reported together under the item Other countries.  Sweden  In Sweden, the fourth quarter was marked by softening demand and was in line with the level at the end of the third quarter.  This has led to a lower utilization rate and lower operating margin compared with year-earlier period.  The utilization rate  increased slightly in the latter part of the quarter, but continues to be at a lower level than in the preceding year. A weakened  market affected the Gothenburg and Malmö region, while the Stockholm region was not impacted to the same degree. In  Malmö, during the fourth quarter, Acando strengthened its management and marketing functions at a local level, which led to  a number of framework agreements being signed with major customers.     During the year, the Management Consulting business area has continuously repositioned itself towards more qualified  services. A clear ambition has been established in the Strategy and Transformation area to capture a position in strategic  advisory services and the implementation of complex change programs, an area of immediate interest in the current financial  climate. In the Supply Chain Management area, healthy demand was noted, often aimed at reducing tied-up capital and  projects linked to enhancing procurement efficiency. In addition, the area of Strategic IT and, in particular, consolidation and  IT streamlining have experienced healthy demand.    The business system area has trended favorably for SAP-based deliveries, while MS Dynamics followed a weaker trend.  However, a number of projects in SAP and MS Dynamics are under discussion with both new and existing customers as a  consequence of intensified sales efforts.    Intensified sales efforts in IT Consulting have had a positive effect in the fourth quarter, with increased utilization and a  number of project-based business opportunities moving forward.  Decision processes for projects continue to be prolonged,  often with decisions at multiple stages and numerous iterations. However the market for consultants is weak, which has led to  a degree of price pressure on the consulting business. Consulting is key for driving utilization rates forward.    YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (20)  www.acando.com  Germany  Operations in Germany continued to trend well in 2012 and the fourth quarter was one of the strongest ever in terms of  margins. Through intense focus on a widening of the customer base and project-based deliveries, the price levels were kept  stable while the utilization rate trended positively. During the year, several new customers were established and developed in  terms of volumes and services.  One example is the portal project implemented by Acando for Olympus during the quarter, which was based on the Content  Management solution, First Spirit. This is a new web solution that creates the conditions necessary for customers to more  quickly and more simply find relevant information, while the content is administered efficiently in over 20 user countries.  Together with the software developer PSINOVA AG, Acando has implemented a major international project with subsequent  roll-out in financial control in SAP. The SAP area is trending well with both streamlining and further development projects.  New legal requirements together with SAP’s focus on new solutions contribute to new projects.  Despite the macroeconomic situation, no directly negative effect was noted on demand or orders.     Norway  In 2012, Acando’s focus on growth in Norway resulted in a total growth in sales of almost 20 percent.    Acando is now an established Microsoft Dynamics CRM supplier and has also established competence in Business Systems.  The position was strengthened by a number of key business deals in the fourth quarter. Organizations that have selected  Acando as supplier include Catella Corporate Finance, the Norwegian Armed Forces Human Resources Centre, the Norwegian  Union of Marine Engineers (NUME) and the Norwegian Association of Authorised Accountants (NARF).     As a delivery area, Strategic IT continues to grow based on major commitments through framework agreements in the public  sector with a major need for recruitment, which has also led to growing business with sub-contractors.    Acando in Norway has achieved Liferay Platinum Partner status.  Liferay Inc. is the supplier of the world’s leading open source  codes, the appointment was due to the Enterprise Portal.     Through the broadened customer base and numerous framework agreements, Acando has captured a favorable position for  continued growth in the Norwegian market.      Other countries  Finland: The decline in volume during the year at one of Acando Finland’s major customers was, in part, compensated during  the fourth quarter by projects started at new customers. Utilization rates and profitability in the fourth quarter were at  historical norms. Focus is on continued expansion of the customer base and SAP as well as SAP-based services.    The UK: In 2012, the customer base was broadened and the dependency on AstraZeneca thereby reduced. A number of  delayed project starts in the fourth quarter negatively impacted utilization rates and, similarly, the operating margin. With a  wider customer base, in both Manchester and London, there are excellent prerequisites for growth and a healthy profitability  trend through Acando’s unique position as supplier of qualified software and project management services.

The town  is located on Borðoy, which is one of the northernmost islands.  The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not  before the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern  Faroese town that became the cultural and commercial centre for the Northern  Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksvik is located between two inlets  lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a  modern fishing fleet.  With the opening of the sub sea tunnel, the  Norðoyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksvík is physically linked with the mainland of  the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports.    SUMMARY OF Q4 2012   MARKETS AND SALES   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   SEGMENT INFORMATION   GROUP FINANCIALS   INVESTMENTS   OUTLOOK  Page 4 BAKKAFROST / Q4 PRESENTATION 2012  BAKKAFROST   – THE LARGEST FISH FARMING COMPANY IN THE FAROE ISLANDS  ~1 10 km      Largest salmon farming company in the Faroe Islands   ~71% of harvest volumes in 2012   50% of farming licenses       Harvested  13,044 tgw in Q4 2012 (11,538 tgw in Q4 2011)   Feed sale of 25,047 tonnes in Q4 2012* (23,612 tonnes in Q4 2011*)     Revenues of DKK 582 million in Q4 2012 (DKK 397 million in Q4 2011)   Operational EBIT of DKK 99 million in Q4 2012 (DKK 46 million in Q4 2011)   Positive results from all segments     Propose dividend of DKK 2 per share (NOK~ 1.97)   Issued unsecured bonds amounting to NOK 500 million  *) Including internal sale of 16,210 tonnes in Q4 2012 ( 17,737 tonnes in Q4 2011).     Page 5 BAKKAFROST / Q4 PRESENTATION 2012  SUMMARY OF Q4 2012    Market   Supply of Atlantic Salmon increased by ~ 12% in Q4 2012 compared to Q4 2011   Differentiation strategy has been successful also in the fourth quarter in 2012  Operational key figures   Improved operational EBIT by 115% from DKK 45.9 million in Q4 2012 to 99.2 million in Q4 2012   Combined Farming/VAP EBIT/kg of NOK 7.3 (Q4 2011: NOK 3.8)   Farming EBIT/kg NOK 6.4 (Q4 2011: NOK 0.8)   VAP EBIT/kg NOK 2.5 (Q4 2011: NOK 9.4)   Feed EBITDA Margin 7.43% (Q4 2011:12.43%)   Operational development   Increased health costs in 2012 compared with 2011   Good biological and operational key numbers    Bakkafrost has decided to switch one of our fjords (Vestmanna) with another company, LUNA (Gøtuvík)

     YEAR-END REPORT  January 1 – December 31, 2013     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported to the Financial Supervisory Authority            1 (23)        YEAR-END REPORT    FOURTH QUARTER OCTOBER 1 – DECEMBER 31, 2013   Net sales SEK 405 m (410)   Operating profit SEK 33 m (33)     Operating margin 8.3% (8.1)   Profit after tax SEK 26 m (21)   Earnings per share SEK 0.37 (0.29)      ACCUMULATED JANUARY 1 – DECEMBER 31, 2013   Net sales SEK 1,438 m (1,547)   Operating profit SEK 66 m (114)     Operating margin 4.6% (7.4)   Profit after tax SEK 50 m (78)   Earnings per share SEK 0.71 (1.09)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 99 m (115)   The Board of Directors intends to propose that the  Annual General Meeting resolve on a dividend of SEK  1.00 per share, corresponding to a total of  approximately SEK 71 m.    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  2013 ended with continued stabilization and improved demand in many of Acando’s markets and we can now see the effects  of the streamlining measures and sales efforts implemented during the year.  This was reflected in the earnings for the  quarter, which were on par with the year-earlier period. The combination of our long-term relationships that provide insight  into the unique situations of our customers with our ability to understand how to best apply the new opportunities from  technology to operations is particularly noticeable now, when the pace of investment is again rising.  The market in Sweden has strengthened continuously and we need to recruit in all operations and geographic regions. We  have entered a transition, in which our traditional IT consultancy operations are becoming increasingly oriented toward  delivery of complete digital solutions based on prepackaged platforms. This also means an increased need for interaction  between our various areas of operation: Management Consulting, Enterprise Solutions and Digital Solutions. It is Acando’s  strength that we freely combine consultants from these three disciplines to deliver total solutions and, accordingly, it is  gratifying to note an increased number of projects spanning all three of our operational areas.  In Sweden, we are particularly proud of our strong and innovative position in the Microsoft field, which was recognized by the  Business Intelligence Partner of the Year Award. We particularly value this award since the motivation highlighted our ability  to identify unique solutions to customers’ problems, which, yet again, showcases our distinct ability to combine business  understanding with the possibilities of technology. We have noted sharply increasing demand for our Analytics services, not  least, linked to the analysis of substantial quantities of data in real time and insight regarding customer behavior on digital  channels.  Our operations in Germany ended the year with a slight recovery, particularly through a healthy profit trend relating to growth  in southern Germany. Our focus on increasing volumes at existing customers has generated results, even if we continue to  assess the market as challenging. We have now implemented the final part of our adaptation to the changed customer  situation in Hamburg and, in 2014, will focus on continued bolstering of existing customer relationships and, thereby, create  the conditions for higher utilization rates and margins in ongoing commitments.  In Norway, expansion continued successfully of our deliveries to the public sector based on a strong portfolio of framework  agreements. The acquisition made in the third quarter has performed well, which means that we now hold a significant  position in Oracle-based business solutions. However, our investment in Microsoft-based offerings followed a negative trend  in the quarter with weak utilization rates as a consequence. A degree of improvement through business won at the start of  2014 and closer integration between Microsoft operations in Sweden and Norway mean, however, that we expect a recovery  in 2014.    YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (23)  www.acando.com  We turn the page on a year that was challenging from many aspects and face 2014 with confidence. During the year, we have  taken the necessary measures to meet a market with focus on delivering solutions and changes that create immediate results.  We stand well equipped for a year filled with exciting new assignments in a world of accelerating change.    YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (23)  www.acando.com  Significant events        Fourth quarter, 2013  In the fourth quarter, Acando signed an agreement with OKQ8 for delivery of a new ERP solution based on Microsoft  Dynamics AX 2012. Acando’s assignment is to realize OKQ8’s goal of managing operations in Scandinavia in one shared  business system. The first project under this partnership aims at implementing shared financial processes for OKQ8’s legal  entities.    Acando has also signed agreements, in partnership with a third party, with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency to support the  agency’s extensive investment in simplifying the sickness benefit process.    Acando also won the assignment to upgrade Moelven Töreboda’s Microsoft Dynamics AX business system from version 4.0 to  the 2012 version.    Acando continues to strengthen its presence in Norway through acquisitions and, in the fourth quarter, Acando expanded  through the acquisition of the Ålesund-based consulting company Cloudstep AS with an acquisition date of January 1, 2014.  Cloudstep AS specializes in cloud-based IT solutions and is one of the largest suppliers of Microsoft Online Services in Norway.  Cloudstep received the Rookie of the Year award from Microsoft Norway in 2013.      Significant events after the end of the period  In January 2014, Acando Norway signed an agreement with Norwegian Society of HVAC Engineers (NORVAC) for a new  membership system based on Microsoft Dynamics CRM in combination with Office 365, the agreement also includes  adaptations and consulting services. In addition, agreements were signed with ACAM AS for a cloud-based solution and with  Lundeby & Co, who will be implementing Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online to support sales efforts.          YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2013     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (23)  www.acando.com  Business activities        Market development  The market recovery noted in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. It was clearest in the Norwegian market  where projects were now being initiated and previously postponed investments reactivated, however, the Finnish market  remained difficult to interpret. Uncertainty remains regarding the market in Germany, even if a slight improvement was  noted.        Customers and offering  Management Consulting posted a positive trend with Strategic IT in continued high demand. Demand was healthy in Supply  Chain Management and issues pertaining to streamlining procurement.   The link between Management Consulting and Analytics is becoming increasingly clear. Many solutions for traditional  management consulting assignments now include an analysis and information management element, which drives demand in  the Analytics area.    Interest in cloud-based delivery models continues to climb. It is worth noting that increasing numbers of Microsoft’s customers  are actively investigating possibilities of migrating from on-premise IT to a cloud-based delivery. The trend is clearest  regarding services linked to Office, SharePoint-based solutions and CRM. Acando’s position is stable with numerous well- established customers and strengthened further during the quarter, through the acquisition of Cloudstep in Norway. Key to  success is the packaging of solutions and their rapid implementation, and Acando has a number of such packages to offer,  which when linked to the handling business-specific requirements provides a unique position.    In the latter part of 2013 and early 2014, several Microsoft Dynamics projects were won and Acando stands out as one of the  leading suppliers of solutions based on Microsoft’s entire offering.

Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  When we closed the books on 2014, we had completed a high-paced business integration and faced, probably, one of  the most exciting years in Acando’s history. During the autumn, we grew at many of our most important and largest  customers in Sweden through expansion of existing assignments and new, challenging projects, often because of our  collective, broader offering and delivery capacity. In parallel, our clear positioning and size in the market creates new  possibilities with, both major global customers and smaller rapidly growing companies. Operations in our other  countries trended favorably toward the end of the year, which provides new possibilities for cross-border deliveries  and the exchange of both solutions and experience. Our capacity to combine strategic insight with acceleration in  implementation makes us unique, and was manifested in a number of our assignments during the quarter.   In terms of results, our operations in Norway and Germany trended strongly during the quarter, and despite a positive  trend in Sweden over the year, we assess that scope exists for continued improvements when the integrated  organization reaches full effect in terms of both costs and revenue synergies. It is equally important that we create an  offering that engages our employees, and I am proud to note that, in the fourth quarter, employee turnover was lower  than it was for Acando during the same period in the preceding year.  Here are a few concrete examples of what we helped our customers with during the quarter: Together with a  telecoms operator, we defined a strategic position and an initial implementation for e-health, we went live with a  large retail solution based on MS Dynamics AX, we created solutions for managing data from automated electricity- meter reading, we are participating in a major modernization program in the bank sector, we were entrusted with  rolling out a global AX solution for a telecom equipment supplier, we are accelerating growth at a small tech start-up,  we went live with a global SAP solution for the paper industry and we are leading one of the largest e-commerce  projects in Sweden.  In the fourth quarter, we completed the integration of Connecta and Acando and, thereby creating the launch pad  under our new brand platform ahead of 2015. Our strategic change initiatives continue at full speed. We secured cost  synergies of SEK 52 m linked to the integration. We are capturing an ever increasing share of projects and major  assignments at increasingly large customers. We work consistently with increasing the proportion of off-shore and  junior consultants using measures including clear incentives and targeted recruitment, for example, through new   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (25)  www.acando.com  trainee programs. We have successfully packaged solutions in several areas, such as Portals and Analytics, which  enables us to reuse solutions at new customers.  Through the merger of Connecta and Acando, we have laid the foundation to continue building Sweden and northern  Europe’s most modern consulting company. Our journey together under a new flag has only just started.    Significant events    Fourth quarter, 2014  During the fourth quarter, integration was completed of Acando and Connecta AB, which was acquired July 23, 2014.  During the quarter, work with coordinating the two operations was completed and a further SEK 6 m was recognized as  an expense in the fourth quarter. Altogether, restructuring costs totaled SEK 65 m and the management estimate that  this will generate annual savings of about SEK 52 m in Sweden. The restructuring costs pertain primarily to termination  costs for former management and administrative personnel at Connecta as well as costs for co-locating operations. The  new merged unit now has a clear position as the leading consulting company in the Nordic region with operations in  Sweden, Norway and Finland as well as favorable expansion opportunities in Germany.    During the fourth quarter, on Microsoft Partner Day for 2014, Acando was again named Dynamics AX Partner of the Year  on the grounds that Acando recorded outstanding performance and posted fantastic growth for AX license business as  well as its delivery capacity through a clear sector focus and strong emphasis on new sales. Through its successfully  packaging of Dynamics together with Microsoft Surface, Acando has become a source of inspiration for other partners.      Significant events after the end of the period  On February 1, 2015, Acando launched its updated brand profile, which is expected to lead to clearer positioning vis-à- vis competitors and increased attractiveness for employees.     At the end of January 2015, Acando divested its operations in the UK with the new owners taking over on February 1.  In the fourth quarter, the surplus value of SEK 7.3 m was written off through goodwill impairment, since the purchase  consideration is expected to correspond to the net assets of the business. The operations are not of significant  importance to the Group and the divesture increases possibilities for focusing on the geographic markets with favorable  conditions for delivering Acando’s entire offering.     On February 5, Acando received the Partner of the Year Award for Middleware, which is presented at an annual event  for Oracle’s partners in Sweden. Acando was awarded the distinction with the following commendation: “This partner  has been part of numerous major transactions during the year. Successful projects were brought to fruition through  solid competence and continued investment in Oracle MW.” Acando Norway received the corresponding award with the  commendation: “Acando is a Norwegian powerhouse in Middleware and service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the  initiative has now become Nordic. During the year, major breakthroughs have been made into the energy market.” The  merger between Acando and Connecta in autumn 2014, doubled the size of operations and, accordingly, the collective  Oracle skills were strengthened in several areas. Connecta has received the Fusion Middleware Partner of the Year  award, for three consecutive years, while Acando Norway, (formerly E-vita) received the award in 2011 and 2013.    YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (25)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Market development  In the fourth quarter, demand posted a slight positive change in both Sweden and Germany. The situation in Norway is  stable, though a degree of concern exists regarding the effect of the oil-price trend. The market in Finland shows  unchanged restraint and all inquiries are characterized by intense competition. For 2015, demand is expected to  continue in line with the end of 2014.      Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, implementation and technology.      Customers and offering  The market is developing in the field of Telecommunications, Information Technology, new Media and Entertainment  (TIME) and Acando’s position is positive, primarily in telecoms with regard to customers among suppliers and operators.  Focus is on operating efficiency, the use of technology in new business models and the establishment of entirely new  services. In the fourth quarter, new assignments were initiated in the gaming and media area, which reflects it being  one of Acando’s investment areas ahead of 2015.    Increasing demand was also noted in the banking, finance and insurance sectors in the form of major modernization  programs and assignments regarding digital end-user services.    Retail remains one of Acando’s strongest segments, with continued expansion at major customers linked to strategies,  implementation and support processes for effective digitization.     Demand is stable in the public sector, with both extended and new assignments spanning several of Acando’s products  and services.          YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (25)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Fourth quarter October – December 2014  Net sales and operating profit before goodwill impairment for the fourth quarter 2014 are shown in the table below:      Consolidated net sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 620 m (405), with growth of 53 percent compared with the year- earlier period.     Operating profit was SEK 52 m (33) before nonrecurring items and goodwill impairment of the UK operations,  corresponding to an operating margin of 8.4 percent (8.3). In Germany, earnings were positively impacted by SEK 5 m  linked to project closeout. The restructuring carried out in the second quarter in Norway has had an impact in parallel  with a favorable utilization rate in the fourth quarter.    Nonrecurring items include final costs totaling SEK 9.0 m connected to the integration of Connecta and Acando, more  details are available in Note 5 on page 23-24.

Connecta’s figures are included for five of the twelve months in the above figures, since its operations were  consolidated into the Acando Group from August 1. For Acando’s previous operations, growth adjusted for currency  effects was 3.8 percent for the full year.    Operating profit was SEK 118 m (66) before nonrecurring items and goodwill impairment of the UK operations,  corresponding to an operating margin of 6.4 percent (4.6). Nonrecurring items included costs totaling SEK 63.5 m  connected to the acquisition of Connecta, as well as restructuring costs of SEK 4.4 m in Norway. The measures are  expected to generate annualized savings of about SEK 52 m in Sweden and, in Norway, the annualized savings are  estimated at about SEK 8 m. Consolidated profit after tax totaled SEK 30 m (50).          Profit trend per quarter   The graph on the right shows net sales and operating  profit for the past four years.   In terms of work, the fourth quarter is the most work  intensive with the highest number of working days. The  third quarter is always lower due to vacation.  The industry in which Acando operates is late-cyclical  and a weak market impacts with a delay of about one  quarter. The same applies when the market turns.                2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 SEK m Net              sales Net              sales Operating  profit* Operating  profit* Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 1 142.1 774.0 93.8 48.5 8.2% 6.3% Germany 294.7 290.6 23.8 11.6 8.1% 4.0% Norway 295.5 224.0 21.5 11.7 7.3% 5.2% Other countries 158.4 159.3 3.9 11.0 2.4% 6.9% Group adjustments -34.3 -10.2 -24.8 -17.2 - - Total operational 1 856.5 1 437.7 118.1 65.7 6.4% 4.6% Items affecting comparabi l i ty - - -67.9 - - - Total 1 856.5 1 437.7 50.2 65.7 2.7% 4.6% *Excluding goodwill impairment January - December 60%16% 16% 8% Net sales Sweden Germany Norway Other countries

Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  In 2015, Acando continued its transition toward becoming northern Europe’s leading consulting company. In terms of  financial performance, for the first time, the Group’s sales surpassed SEK 2 billion and, an operating profit of SEK 168  m means we posted the largest profit in the company’s history. Profitability has been continuously strengthened during  the year in all of our key geographies. Over the last few years, the structural changes in Germany and Norway, with  changed customer bases, operational efficiency enhancements and a focus on services with high growth potential, have  contributed to Acando’s strong market position and increased profitability on a full-year basis. The synergies we  expected in Sweden from the fusion of Acando and Connecta, both in terms of efficiency enhancements and new  customer opportunities, were fully realized during the year and have created increased profitability driven by higher  utilization rates through large project-driven deliveries and a broad offering in the most interesting industries.  We are continuing to develop into a distinct digital transformation partner. The breadth of our offering, spanning  strategic insight to digital innovation together with a high implementation capacity, generates new opportunities on a  daily basis.   Industries and sectors that we previously perceived as traditional are now digital pioneers and our most important digital  partners. We work with intelligent transport systems, advanced map and traffic information services and autonomous  vehicles in Norway. We are simplifying the communication between drivers and vehicles at one of our German  customers, and analyzing the consequences of digital scenarios at one of our Swedish transport-sector customers. We  are also proud to have won the Swedish Transport Administration’s confidence and, together with our partners, have  been entrusted with enhancing the efficiency and increasing the precision of maintenance work through improved and  more standardized information management. The project is one of Acando’s largest and was awarded in the face of  competition from global competitors. Our ability to identify the most relevant technical solution, our experience of  complex projects and close interaction with customers and partners gives us an advantage. Naturally, the fact that the  project also contributes to increased public welfare makes us particularly proud.   We believe in a world with greater ability, where we contribute to creating greater value by accelerating talents and  making talent available to our customers. We are proud of everyone who has chosen to be part of Acando, of all the  initiatives that are taken and all the times customers invest their trust in us. The power of our collective ability and the  ambition in each and every one of us, sets us apart.   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (28)  www.acando.com  Sometimes, what we represent can really make one stand tall. For instance, when an employee took the initiative to  use a hackathon in Norway, a UN conference and an award in Abu Dhabi to, in some mysterious way, arrive at a press  conference on Mauritius with the Mauritian Minister of the Environment, which was covered by all the national media,  to discuss digital innovation as a support for biological diversity. Read more about biocaching at www.biocaching.com  and at facebook.com/biocaching.    Significant events    Fourth quarter, 2015  Acando signed an agreement with the Swedish Transport Administration covering the implementation of a new IT  solution to manage construction data for the road and rail networks in Sweden. The solution is being implemented under  the framework of the Swedish Transport Administration’s ANDA project and is intended to partially replace existing  systems and, moreover, add new functionality. The solution will enable the Swedish Transport Administration to  introduce new traffic management, maintenance and planning processes that require an enhanced and more  standardized assets register. Furthermore, the solution will create possibilities for more efficient administration of the  Swedish Transport Administration’s information needs through shared solutions and procedures. The implementation  will also allow increased precision with regard to maintenance measures.    In the fourth quarter, Acando in Norway was awarded a framework agreement with the Norwegian Labour and Welfare  Service (NAV), for architecture and software requirement specification consulting services. Acando is ranked first in this  skills area. The aim of the agreement is to help NAV with consulting services pertaining to architecture and software  requirement specification in a number of areas. The framework agreement extends for a period of four years.    Acando launched Acando Digital Insights 2015, this is one of the key insights ahead of 2016 and is based on a study of  200 large Swedish companies. Despite a positive trend in development, the companies’ efforts have led to surprisingly  few results. Those companies that have progressed furthest in the digital area have integrated digital issues with their  business strategy. However, of the worst performers, only one in ten have succeeded in formulating a digital objective.     In Norway, Acando won a framework agreement with the Norwegian Police’s Shared Services (PFT), for the procurement  of architecture services for justice sector operations. In Norway, extensive, long-term development efforts are ongoing  in the justice sector, particularly within the police. Together with the Norwegian Police ICT Services (PIT), the  Norwegian National Police Directorate (POD) is responsible for extensive and varied projects aimed at development and  renewal.  The digital integration of the judicial system is a prioritized area and the aim is to achieve improved coordination,  thereby achieving efficiency and quality gains. The framework agreement runs for two years with an option to extend  for a further two years.       Significant events after the end of the period  Acando has been contracted to conduct a larger study on streamlining flows in the health sector.       YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (28)  www.acando.com  Business activities          Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept, in partnership with its customers, is to create business value  by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,700 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and delivery centers in  India and Latvia.          Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in place to  be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish company with a  sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions to be able to successfully  compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:    Management pertains to consulting services and accelerated implementation in connection with strategic change and  includes innovation and optimizing the use of technology as key elements of the offering. Disruptive business models,  enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and demand  for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.     Enterprise drives projects based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems are key to  driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX and SAP,  with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle. Continued  efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s move toward  cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where Acando has a  favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.      Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are driven by a  combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on modern technology  and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly  growing areas.   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (28)  www.acando.com    Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.    Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.           Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry.     The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer behavior patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted driven by  a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In combination with  regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many companies in the  sector.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. A declining propensity for investment has  been noted in the oil and gas segment.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for efficiency,  increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens.   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1 – December 31, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (28)  www.acando.com  The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  operators.                      Market trend in the fourth quarter  Demand in Sweden remains healthy and on a par with 2015, albeit with certain geographical differences where  Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region comprise growth areas. In Germany, the demand situation remained normal for  the full year. The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with an  increasingly noticeable decline in the willingness to invest in oil-related sectors, thus resulting in increasing competition  for available assignments. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious. The assessment is that  the conditions and the trends noted at the end of 2015 will continue into 2016, however, uncertainty in the macro  environment could impact demand.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation, implementation and technology.

Harvested  volumes were 13.7 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 238.7 million in Q4 2015. The Farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 215.0 million. Although the global salmon spot prices increased during the quarter, the VAP  segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 23.7 million in Q4 2015. The EBITDA for the FOF segment  was DKK 44.8 million in Q4 2015.  The Group made a profit for the quarter of DKK  318.6 million (DKK 222.4 million). For 2015, the  profit was DKK 810.2 million (DKK 647.1 million).  The total volumes harvested in Q4 2015 were  13,675 tonnes gutted weight (12,651 tgw). Total  harvested volumes for 2015 were 50,565 tonnes  gutted weight (44,013 tgw).  Bakkafrost transferred 4.9 million smolts in Q4 2015  (3.2 million). In 2015, Bakkafrost has transferred  11.3 million smolts (10.4 million). This is 0.9 million  more than the forecast for smolt release for 2015 as  some smolts, planned to be released in January  2016, were released in December 2015.  In accordance with the Group’s dividend policy,  Bakkafrost aims at giving its shareholders a com- petitive return on their investment, both through  payment of dividends and by securing an increase  in the value of the equity through positive oper- ations. The long-term goal of the Board of Directors  is that 30 - 50% of earnings per share shall be paid  out as dividend. Bakkafrost’s financial position is  strong with a healthy balance sheet, a competitive  operation and available credit facilities. The Board  of Directors proposes therefore to the Annual Gen- eral Meeting that DKK 8.25 (NOK 10.38*) per share  shall be paid out as dividend. This corresponds to  approximately DKK 403.1 million (NOK 507.0* mil- lion). The proposed dividend corresponds to 46.2%  of adjusted earnings for 2015. The Annual General  Meeting will be convened on 8 April 2016.  The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 238.7 million (DKK 213.8  million) in Q4 2015. For 2015, the combined farming  and VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 927.3 million (DKK 763.9 million).  The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 215.0 million (DKK 181.4 million) in Q4 2015.  The harvested volumes are higher in Q4 2015,  compared to Q4 2014, and operational EBIT like- wise higher. For 2015, the operational EBIT was  DKK 841.2 million (DKK 694.0 million).  The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 23.7 million (DKK 32.4 million) for Q4 2015.  The operational EBIT in the VAP segment de- creased both due to higher prices on raw material in  the quarter and lower volumes. For 2015, the oper- ational EBIT was DKK 86.1 million (DKK 69.9 mil- lion).  The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 44.8 million (DKK 40.8  million) in Q4 2015. This corresponds to an oper- ational EBITDA margin of 18.7% (18,1%). The op- erational EBITDA was DKK 202.1 million for 2015  (DKK 181.6 million), corresponding to an EBITDA  margin for 2015 of 19.3% (18.7%).  In Q4 2015, Havsbrún sourced 63,582 tonnes of  raw material (21,918 tonnes) and in 2015, Havsbrún  sourced 235,014 tonnes of raw material (193,231  tonnes).  The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 391.5 million at the end of Q4  2015 (DKK 232.7 million at year-end 2014) includ- ing deposits and losses on financial derivatives re- lating to the interest bearing debt.  In December 2015, Bakkafrost secured the refi- nancing of its bank loan that would have matured at  the end of 2016. The new financing agreement both  extends and restructures Bakkafrost’s credit facil- ities. The new bank loan is a multicurrency revolving  credit facility for a period of five years, totalling DKK  850 million. In addition to the DKK 850 million credit  facility, the new financing agreement has an accor- dion increase option of maximum DKK 750 million.  Bakkafrost had undrawn credit facilities of approxi- mately DKK 889.6 million, of which DKK 38.3 million  were restricted at the end of Q4 2015.  Bakkafrost’s equity ratio at 31 December 2015 was  66%, compared with 60% at the end of 2014.  * The dividend per share in NOK is subject to changes depending on the  exchange rate between DKK and NOK when the dividend is paid out.     Condensed Consolidated Interim Report for Q4 2015 and 12 Months 2015   Issued February 24th 2016          4  Financial Review  (Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year)    Income Statement   The operating revenues amounted to DKK 759.7  million in Q4 2015 (DKK 757.3 million). Although the  prices have improved and harvested volumes are  higher in Q4 2015, compared with Q4 2014, the rev- enue is almost the same as the revenue in the VAP  segment has decreased. For 2015, the operating  revenues amounted to DKK 2,850.4 million (DKK  2,683.3 million).    Operational EBIT in Q4 2015 was DKK 256.5 million  (DKK 227.5 million). The margins in the Farming  and FOF segment are higher in Q4 2015, than Q4  2014, while the margin in VAP is lower. For 2015,  the operational EBIT was DKK 1,000.6 million (DKK  833.8 million).    The fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological  assets amounted to DKK 83.1 million in Q4 2015  (DKK 51.6 million). The adjustment is due to higher  salmon spot prices in DKK at the end of Q4 2015,  compared with the beginning of the quarter. The fair  value adjustment is negatively affected by DKK 52  million, as the new license tax from 2016 will be  classified as cost. For 2015, the fair value  adjustment amounted to DKK -27.6 million (DKK - 11.5 million).    Provisions were made for onerous contracts of DKK  -51.0 million (DKK 0.0 million) in Q4 2015. The  provisions have been recognised due to the high  salmon price at the end of 2015. Bakkafrost made  provisions in 2015 amounting to DKK -51.0 million  (DKK 70.9 million).  In Q4 2015, there was a profit from associated  companies amounting to DKK 20.3 million (DKK         -4.0 million). For 2015, the income from associated  companies amounted to DKK 6.8 million (DKK             -0.8 million).    Net interests in Q4 2015 were DKK 0.7 million (DKK  38.9 million), whereof a positive unrealised ex- change rate adjustment of DKK 3.6 million relating  to the bond loan of NOK 500 million is posted in Q4  2015. Net interests for 2015 were DKK -4.3 million  (DKK 6.9 million).    Net taxes in Q4 2015 amounted to DKK 9.0 million  (DKK -91.7 million). For 2015, net taxes amounted  to DKK -114.3 million (DKK -252.1 million). The  Faroese Parliament changed the taxes on salmon  farming in the Faroe Islands in December 2015. The  tax changes are effective from January 2016, but  the changes affected deferred taxes in 2015.  Consequently, the deferred taxes were reduced by  DKK 79.8 million and the reduction was recognised  as a positive tax in the income statement in Q4  2015.    The result for Q4 2015 was DKK 318.6 million (DKK  222.4 million). The result for 2015 was DKK 810.2  million (DKK 647.1 million).

     YEAR-END REPORT  January 1–December 31, 2016     Price-sensitive information that  has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority    ___________________________________________________________________________________________________        1 (29)        YEAR-END REPORT    FOURTH QUARTER OCTOBER 1–DECEMBER 31, 2016   Net sales of SEK 633 m (565)   Operating profit SEK 82 m (62)      Operating margin 12.9% (10.9)     Profit after tax was SEK 67 m (60)   Earnings per share were SEK 0.65 (0.59)  ACCUMULATED JANUARY 1–DECEMBER 31, 2016   Net sales of SEK 2,206 m (2,115)   Operating profit SEK 210 m (168)      Operating margin 9.5% (7.9)     Profit after tax was SEK 180 m (131)   Earnings per share were SEK 1.75 (1.27)   Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 72 m (93)    The Board intends to propose that the AGM resolve to  distribute a dividend of SEK 1.30 (1.20) per share,  corresponding to a total of about SEK 134 m (123).    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO    We ended the year with continued strong financial trends in all geographies. We continue to grow and raise our margin,  and we are proud to deliver the highest operating profit in Acando’s history, representing an increase in profit of 25  percent for the full year. Sales for the fourth quarter of SEK 633 m corresponded to fourth-quarter growth of 12 percent  and an operating margin of 12.9 percent made this one of the strongest ever quarters.     Technology is far more than an enabler, it is a driver that creates innovation and efficiency in entirely new ways — for us  and for our customers. We have noted in an increasing number of our assignments that the digitalization of products and  services coordinates with opportunities in traditional business-process-driven IT. We are noticing how increasingly  complex value chains and solutions are being built in shorter timeframes. At these speeds, focus on user behavior becomes  an increasingly important element in how solutions are defined and implemented. The pace of change is high and the  ability of organizations to mature digitally and maximize the leverage of their investments is becoming a journey of  change in itself.    At Acando, we have a unique, collective ability, whereby we combine deep technical expertise with insight into customer  and user behavior, where our experience of driving complex, strategic transformative processes at high speed in  partnership with our customers becomes the norm, and where our culture of strong individual ownership and a high  collective ability give us a unique advantage in how we relate to our customers and partners. Altogether, our perception  is that we have never been better positioned to leverage the increasingly rapid digital reality that we live in. We have  high credibility with our customers and we attract talent, and these factors have never been more relevant. But we are  not resting on our laurels — we continue to challenge ourselves to always be defining new possibilities where we can make  a difference.     Over the last year, we have driven driverless buses in Norway, built a digital innovation agency, Itch, created an entirely  new digital transformation offering in Germany, put 100 trainees through our program and delivered a modern digital  workplace to 100,000 people. We have won all the framework-agreement renewals in Norway, delivered our most complex  Microsoft Dynamics project on time and on budget, and won the SAP S4 upgrade project. We have implemented our two  largest ever project assignments, created customer insight through advanced data-driven analysis, established industrial  IoT and machine learning as skills areas and much more besides.    Acando’s vision is “A more capable world,” and through each assignment we create greater capabilities; in ourselves, our  employees, our customers and in our operating environment, and we have only just got started!   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1–December 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (29)  www.acando.com  Significant events during and after the quarter      In October, Acando in Germany acquired a majority holding in the company Brickmakers Gmbh. Brickmakers are specialists  in app development and web-based solutions. Through this acquisition, Acando Germany acquired a further 25 senior  consultants, mainly skilled in the design, development and usability of mobile and web-based applications.     In Norway, Acando has signed an agreement with Sopra Steria regarding case management projects for the Norwegian  Labour and Welfare Service (NAV). Acando is supplying skills and capacity in the fields of architecture and system  development. The agreement applies for an initial period of three years and is maximized at seven years.    In Sweden, Acando has signed an agreement with Electrolux to implement a new global digital workplace. The contract  extends for three years with an option to extend for a further two years and covers realization and administration. The  new digital workplace is based on Microsoft Office 365 and Acando’s packaged solution Acando Collaboration Platform  (ACP).    Acando in Norway signed a framework agreement with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) for IT consulting  services. The framework agreement applies for IT delivery assignments, skills assignments and specialized services  assignments. The agreement runs for two years with the possibility of extension for two further years. The agreement  aims to cover the skills need in terms of IT services and the need for independent external assignments, and can also be  used when extra capacity is needed. The NPRA has been a customer of Acando for several years and Acando possesses  extensive industry experience from many years of collaboration.    Acando has signed a framework agreement with Stockholm County Council for IT consultants for assignments. The  agreement covers three areas of assignment consultancy services, and entails Acando taking primary responsibility for  the result of a defined, specific assignment. The framework agreement encompasses the county council’s administration,  companies and foundations (with the exception of AB SL/Traffic Committee), Region Gotland, TioHundra AB, the Swedish  Association of Local Authorities and Regions, and Inera AB. The agreement extends for a maximum of three years and  covers services for system development and business intelligence, as well as implementations.    Acando in Norway has won a framework agreement with Hälsa Innkjøpsservice AS (HINAS). The framework agreement with  Acando covers IT services. The agreement runs for two years with the possibility of extension for two further years. The  contract with HINAS is an important confirmation of our earlier deliveries and expertise in the area. The healthcare sector  is facing major digitalization projects. Efficient and user-friendly IT solutions can liberate more time for primary tasks  and enable improved patient treatment and services. Together with Acando, Metier and IT-Consult have formed a  partnership based on harnessing the companies’ combined capacity and expertise to provide optimal deliveries to HINAS.  This joint constellation with Acando as main contractor together with subcontractors results in a unit comprising 3,000  employees in Scandinavia, of which more than 1,000 are employed in Norway.              YEAR-END REPORT   January 1–December 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (29)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept is, in partnership with its customers, to create business value  through innovation and by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions. We stand out due to  our ability to combine skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise, insight into user behavior  and deep understanding of how organizations and change function. The Group has approximately 1,700 employees  allocated over four countries in Europe and a delivery center in Latvia.      Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of all of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in  place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish company with a  sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions to be able to successfully  compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:    Management Consulting pertains to consulting services and accelerated implementation in connection with strategic  change and includes innovation and optimizing the use of technology as key elements of the offering. Disruptive business  models, enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and  demand for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.     Within Enterprise projects are driven based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems  are key to driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX  and SAP, with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle.  Continued efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s  move toward cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where  Acando has a favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.      Digital guides customers and realizes solutions, products and services linked to digital innovation and transformation.  Projects are driven by a combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based  on modern technology and platforms. These are always conducted with a focus on end-user and consumer behavior. The  area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly growing areas.  Acando’s digital innovation agency, Itch, is a key element in developing Acando’s offering within digital services and  product innovation.  Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.     YEAR-END REPORT   January 1–December 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (29)  www.acando.com  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.           Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both Sweden and Germany, and  with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway.     The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major full-service assignments with  several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted that is  driven by a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In  combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many  companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments linked to leading the transformation and  development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. Given historically low oil prices, a  declining propensity for investment has been noted in the oil and gas segment. Acando has extensive experience and a  strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy companies and a number of smaller local companies.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for efficiency,  increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong position in Norway comprises the base for  continued expansion in terms of content and geographical coverage.   YEAR-END REPORT   January 1–December 31, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (29)  www.acando.com    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.  Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.              Market trend in the fourth quarter  Demand in Sweden remained healthy and stable throughout 2016. All regions in Sweden trended positively driven by the  need for digitalization. In Germany, demand remained normal during the period. The market in Norway was  characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with a decline in the willingness to invest in oil-related  sectors, thus resulting in increasing competition for available assignments. The weakest market is Finland, where the  market remains cautious albeit with a slight positive trend.     Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation, digital content in products and services, and completely new application areas for technology in  business processes. Accordingly, it will become crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation,  implementation, user behavior and technology.

  YEAR-END REPORT  January 1–December 31, 2017  Price-sensitive information that  Has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (25)  Year-end report    Third quarter October 1–December 31, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 693 m (633)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 87 m (82)   > The operating margin was 12.5% (12.9)  > Profit after tax was SEK 67 m (67)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.64 (0.65)          Accumulated January 1–December 31, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 2,444 m (2,206)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 243 m (210)   > The operating margin was 10.0% (9.5)  > Profit after tax was SEK 180 m (180)  > Earnings per share were SEK 1.73 (1.75)  > Cash and cash equivalents tot SEK 90 m (72)  > The Board intends to propose that the AGM  resolve to distribute a dividend of SEK 1.40  (1.30) per share, corresponding to a total of  about SEK 145 m (134).  Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  2017 was another record year for all of us at Acando. The fourth quarter resulted in continued growth and  increased earnings. For the full year, sales increased 11 percent to SEK 2,444 m and operating profit rose 16  percent to SEK 243 m. The quarter included the highest sales, the highest margin and accordingly, the highest  profit in Acando’s history. Our financial position is healthy and the Board proposes raising the dividend to SEK  1.40 per share, corresponding to SEK 145 m to our owners, the highest dividend in Acando’s history.  For us, the most critical factor is to continue to contribute to our customers’ success, at the same time as we  continuously develop, both as individuals and as an organization. In a world of changing customer behavior,  brand new competitors and with technology as a powerful innovation driver – we can clearly see how our  customers are seeking new routes. During the year, we took further steps to realize our strategy, the essence  of which is “Technology Driven and Behavior Centric.” We have implemented some of our most advanced and  challenging projects at the same time as we continuously developed new talents and captured an increasingly  clear position for our customers as a partner with which to create innovation and generate long-term lasting  results.  We have continuously strengthened our position in the consumer-driven industries. Retail is one example of  an environment that is undergoing fundamental change. Our skills in understanding behavior and how best to  leverage new technologies and platforms to create optimal customer experiences provides us with a clear and  somewhat unique position. During the year, we completed projects for an established global company that in  record time created completely new opportunities for both digital and physical customer experiences. In  partnership with another customer, we explored how augmented reality can create entirely new customer  experiences and how these options impact everything from strategies for product development to product  launches. We know that success with sustainable change in such environments requires combining the  strategy, customer and technology perspectives. We do this in Acando Business Design Studio, a unit we    YEAR-END REPORT  January 1–December 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (25)  established during the year and through which we now successfully compete with leading global companies  in our market.   Increasingly, our projects include greater elements of advanced analytics of big data. During the year, we  strengthened our capabilities in Analytics and Machine Learning, and we delivered projects that successfully  enhanced care outcomes through prediction, created improved customer experiences in digital channels, and  made tv archives searchable for concepts including “facial expressions” and “tonality.”   We are also growing in the Digital Industry segment, where we foresee the next substantial wave of investment.  In terms of the industrial use of IoT, we successfully established ourselves as a partner for customers in the  fourth quarter. We increasingly operate within our customers’ product development projects and our  geographic presence and expertise make us a natural partner in the ongoing transition in the automotive and  transportation industry by using brand new technologies and new emerging customer behaviors.  The only certainty is that we will continue to develop and our ability to change in pace with our operating  environment will be decisive to our success. The year we have just ended shows that we are able to change  and grow, but can also create environments that allow each and every one of our employees the opportunity  to grow. We believe the world will increasingly be driven by technology but that understanding of human  behavior will always be key to creating the best solutions. It’s what we are — Technology Driven and Behavior  Centric.        Significant events during and after the quarter  At the start of December, Acando Germany acquired Anywhere.24 GmbH – a company specialized in  Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 CRM solution. Anywhere.24 offers cloud-based solutions and is one of the leading  Microsoft Dynamics 365 partners in Germany. With over 15 years of CRM experience, the company operates  across Germany and is particularly well-known for its integrated use of the whole Microsoft Dynamics 365  product suite. Anywhere.24 is headquartered in Munich and employs 60 staff. The operations will be  consolidated from January 1, 2018.  On October 1, all of the shares in the Norwegian company Bitvis AS were acquired. Bitvis is a design center  for FPGA and embedded software development. The company provides highly specialized development  services to a broad spectrum of customers, from start-ups to major companies in the electronics industry. Bitvis  is involved in many prestigious projects within space, defense, offshore, telecommunications, avionics, radar  systems, multimedia devices, industrial applications and healthcare. Bitvis has also developed unique tools,  intellectual property, in the form of simulation software for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) verification.  Through the acquisition, Acando strengthens its digital transformation offering. Everything related to Industry  4.0 requires deep technological know-how, and the acquisition of Bitvis forms a key step in assisting our clients  within IoT, embedded software and FPGA (programmable digital logic). The combination of Acando’s expertise  in management consulting, advanced analytics, machine learning and AI, will create a unique technology  environment in the Norwegian market.  Acando won an assignment to support a major Swedish bank with ensuring compliance in new EU  requirements linked to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). The main purpose of the  directive is to strengthen investor protection, increase transparency and disclosure in the securities markets  and, at the same time, provide regulatory bodies with an improved overview and control. The directive applies  to essentially all securities markets participants, and to almost all securities products and asset classes  covered by the new regulatory framework. The assignment includes responsibility for leading the program  office and communication.    YEAR-END REPORT  January 1–December 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (25)  A global retailer has produced a solution that presents products to customers on mobile devices in a completely  new way. Acando will support driving this work forward now that the technology is being integrated into the  existing customer decision journey as well as the company’s strategies and processes. The retailer’s new  mobile channel is based on augmented reality technology that enables customers to experience the company’s  products in the physical space that the customer happens to be occupying. The technology has great potential  and only a fraction of what is possible has been developed to date. In parallel with the development of new  functionality, the project will be drawing up plans to make this channel part of the company’s future strategies  and processes.  Acando Norway won a framework agreement from the Norwegian Coastal Administration together with Asplan  Viak Internet AS (Avinet), Acando AS and Oslo Industrial Logic (OIL) for the development and delivery of a  data warehouse for maritime data. As can be deduced from its name, the Norwegian Coastal Administration  is responsible for coastal administration, maritime safety and contingency planning in Norway. At present, the  agency has considerable quantities of data available through internal and external systems regarding freight,  unloading and vessel traffic services, weather conditions, navigational installations, accidents and incidents,  pollution and emissions, as well as its own administrative tasks. The project is being started together with the  Norwegian Coastal Administration to create a maritime data warehouse. The data warehouse needs to be able  to manage several billion positions each year and demands in terms of a positive user experience have been  set high.    Acando Sweden has delivered a new digital workplace for trading firm, Ekman & Co AB. The digital workplace,  which is realized using Office 365 and Acando’s accelerator, the Acando Collaboration Platform, comprises a  key link in the digitalization process that Ekman is currently in the midst of. Ekman has transitioned from a  SharePoint-based intranet to a digital workplace that fully utilizes Office 365 and the platform’s functions. The  digital workplace aims to create a more efficient partnership within the company and to meet the employees’  rising requirements for modern tools. Moreover, new possibilities are created for collaborating with external  parties.    Acando has won an assignment to support a global industrial group with project management and advisory  services covering the implementation of processes and IT support for strategic purchasing. Improving strategic  purchasing means the company will be able to work more effectively and, moving forward, ensure the right  agreements and suppliers are used.     A global leader in Medtech has chosen Acando as its business development partner. Acando will perform an  operational audit to identify improvements in the company’s patient interface and in its manufacturing flows.    After the end of the period, Acando won the assignment to develop identity administration at Folksam. The  new platform will simplify the administration of rights.     Acando has won an assignment to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  for a global manufacturer of forest, park and garden products. Numerous parts of the organization need to be  reviewed to ensure the company’s administration of personal data meets the GDPR requirements. Acando will  prepare and design new processes based on the requirements set by the GDPR. Moreover, a gap analysis is  being prepared for a number of critical systems with the aim of understanding the impact that GDPR and the  new processes will have on the system. Moreover, Acando will review all critical agreements to understand  how these need to be adapted to meet the GDPR requirements. Thereafter, a GDPR administration unit, which  Acando will help the company set up, will ensure long-term GDPR compliance and make certain the company  administers and develops relevant work methods.     YEAR-END REPORT  January 1–December 31, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (25)  Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and  human behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change.

Bakkafrost will continue to develop the brood stock  program, renting the existing brood stock facilities  from P/F Fiskaaling until 2021. During the next three  years, Bakkafrost will examine the feasibility of the  brood stock program and determine, whether invest- ments in a new brood stock facility will be needed.

The long-term goal of the Board of Directors is that  30-50% of earnings per share shall be paid out as  dividend. The financial position of Bakkafrost is strong  with a solid balance sheet, a competitive operation  and available credit facilities. Therefore, the Board of  Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting  that DKK 10.50 (NOK 13.65*) per share shall be paid  out as dividend. The proposed dividend corresponds  to 50% of adjusted earnings for 2017. The Annual  General Meeting will be convened on the 13th of April  2018.    The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest-bearing debt  amounted to DKK 258.1 million at the end of 2017  (DKK 635.3 million at year-end 2016) including de- posits and losses on financial derivatives relating to  the  interest-bearing  debt.  Bakkafrost had  undrawn                   credit facilities of DKK 1,004.6 million at the end of  2017.     In January 2018, Bakkafrost made an agreement with  its existing lender, Nordea, to refinance its existing  DKK 850 million bank facility and its outstanding NOK  500 million bond loan, which has a maturity during  Q1 2018, with a senior secured five-year EUR 200  million credit facility.     The facility includes an accordion increase option,  which provides flexibility for the parties to agree an  increased size of the facility by further up to EUR 200  million during the term of the facility.     The facility is subject to signing a facility agreement,  which is expected to take place during Q1 2018.    Bakkafrost’s equity ratio was 70% at 31 December  2017, compared to 66% at the end of 2016.    * The dividend per share in NOK is subject to changes depending on the  exchange rate between DKK and NOK, which will be announced after the  Annual General Meeting.

In 2014 the Jan-Sep CAPEX includes the acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    The fourth quarter 2014 marks the end of an important transitional year for AINMT, particularly for the  company’s Norwegian operation. Although the group delivers a strong EBITDA improvement, our primary  focus throughout the year has been to build a platform for tomorrow’s AINMT group – a fully-fledged,  data-focused operator of 4G mobile broadband and, in Norway, smartphone services. In that respect, we  have met some major milestones in the fourth quarter and into 2015:    Firstly, on October 1st, Ice Communication Norge AS announced an agreement to acquire most of Tele2’s  mobile network infrastructure should the competition authority approve TeliaSonera’s acquisition of  Tele2 in Norway.     Secondly, On November 11th, AINMT signed a deal with Alcatel-Lucent to deploy 4G LTE and IP  networking solutions to be rolled out in 2015. We already offer the most comprehensive geographical  coverage; now the aim is to enhance speed and capacity and launch mobile broadband services on LTE.     Thirdly, there were ongoing negotiations with TeliaSonera regarding additional remedies that the latter  submitted to the Norwegian Competition Authority in order to receive approval for the acquisition of  Tele2’s Norwegian operation.       AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2014  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354      Page 2 (19)  Subsequent to the fourth quarter, on 5th February 2015, the Norwegian Competition Authority approved  TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Tele2’s Norwegian operation which has a major impact for AINMT’s  Norwegian operation. This ensured that a comprehensive package of remedies – including the acquisition  of Network Norway and a national roaming agreement with TeliaSonera came into effect in addition to Ice  Communication Norge AS’s agreement to acquire most of Tele2’s mobile network infrastructure.     AINMT’s Norwegian operation in the space of 15 months has positioned itself to develop from a pure-play  provider of mobile broadband services to becoming Norway’s third largest mobile network operator.     While 2014 was a transitional and foundation-creating year, 2015 will be a year of further developing the  infrastructure, tools and businesses that we have secured throughout the past 15 months. From March 1st  2015, we will almost double our revenue base in Norway, where we also start operating as a smartphone  player. This foundation has put us in a highly interesting challenger position in the Norwegian market, and  is something we will be able to harvest the results from over the coming years.     Significant events during the fourth quarter     Ice Communication Norge AS and Tele2-owned Mobile Norway AS announced an agreement on  lease of 5 MHz in the 900 MHz band, from October 1st 2014 to April 1st 2015. The Q4 service  revenue is positively impacted by this spectrum lease.   Ice Communications Norge AS announced a deal to acquire most of Tele2’s mobile network  infrastructure if the Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera AB’s acquisition of  Tele2 in Norway.   AINMT signed an agreement with Alcatel-Lucent to deploy 4G LTE and IP networking solutions  throughout Scandinavia.     Summary of 2014     In Q1 2014, AINMT Group, through AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS, successfully issued a SEK 1.5  billion High Yield Bond (ISIN NO 001 0705601) at 9.75% interest rate with semi-annual interest  payments. Settlement date was 19 March 2014; maturity date is 19 March 2019. First payment  was made on September 19th 2015. Part of the bond’s proceeds was used to repay certain  external loans.   In connection with the bond issue, AINMT Holdings AB transferred its Scandinavian subsidiaries  to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS.    On October 1st, Ice Communication Norge AS and Tele2-owned Mobile Norway AS announced an  agreement on lease of 5 MHz in the 900 MHz band, from October 1st 2014 to April 1st 2015.    On October 1st, Ice Communications Norge AS also announced a deal to acquire parts of Tele2’s  mobile network infrastructure if the Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera  AB’s acquisition of Tele2 in Norway.   On 11 November 2014 AINMT signed an agreement with Alcatel-Lucent to deploy a 4G LTE and IP  networking solutions throughout Scandinavia. The network will be rolled out during 2015.   AINMT’s Swedish operation delivered first positive full year EBITDA.       AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2014  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354      Page 3 (19)  Significant events after the end of the period    On 5 February 2015, the Norwegian Competition Authority approved TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Tele2’s  Norwegian operation. As a result of the approval, AINMT’s Norwegian operation (ice.net) and TeliaSonera  announced an agreement that is effective from 1st March 2015 and covers the following:      ice.net will acquire Network Norway’s business-to-business customer base and the Network  Norway brand   ice.net will acquire Officer AS, Norway’s fastest growing retailer of mobile communication  solutions, with dealerships throughout Norway   ice.net retains an option to acquire the 2100 MHz spectrum, subject to government approval   ice.net enters into a six-year national roaming agreement (NRA) with TeliaSonera.    A co-location agreement giving ice.net access to TeliaSonera’s sites at beneficial rates and  conditions    As a result of the Competition Authority approval, Ice Communication Norge AS’s deal to purchase parts of  Tele2’s mobile network infrastructure was made effective from 5th February 2015.      Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 102 versus 77 for the equivalent period  the previous year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and  subcontractors, the Group employed 126 (90) people.    Incentive plans encourage employees to remain loyal to the business. In turn, retaining high quality  employees saves us money and is good for the long-term development of the company. That is why we in  Q4 2014 introduced a long-term incentive programme for selected employees in our organisation. The  programme consists of warrants/employee stock options to purchase shares in the parent company,  AINMT Holdings AB, with a vesting period of four years.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible assets amounted to kNOK -5,447 (1,181) for the fourth quarter of the  year while investments in tangible assets amounted to kNOK 19,073 (41,171). The corresponding  numbers for the year was kNOK 716,973 (3,463), including the acquisition of Ice Communication Norge  AS that was awarded the spectrum licences in Norway in December 2013 and, kNOK 41,608 (106,362).    Investments in intangible assets consist of frequency spectrum licences and capitalised costs for research  and development. Investments in tangible assets are primarily related to network capacity expansions,  both on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the fourth quarter amounts to kNOK 18,338 (8,214) and the total  year-to-date amounts to kNOK 27,808 (25,175). Non-recurring items are mainly related to inventory  revaluations and restructuring measurements, and for Q4 2014 an initial one-time cost related to the Long  Term Incentive programme is recognised. Non-recurring items 2013 also holds costs related to  international expansions outside Scandinavia.        AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2014  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354      Page 4 (19)  Risks and factors of uncertainty    AINMT Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings  or its financial position.

CEO’s statement    The main highlights for the fourth quarter were sustained high sales figures for our Norwegian operation and  further strengthening of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS’s balance sheet.     Customer acquisition in Norway continues to be a key focus. Encouragingly, ice.net’s sales of consumer  mobile phone subscriptions in the fourth quarter have been retained at the solid level we saw throughout  both the second and third quarter. Churn is down again to industry leading level following the migration  process in the second and third quarter. All in all, we are very satisfied with the net growth in consumer  mobile phone subscriptions in Norway.    Ahead of schedule, ice.net started to generate smartphone on-net data traffic in the fourth quarter, including  in Drammen, Larvik, Oslo and Fredrikstad. Base stations covering approximately 40 percent of the population  have now been prepared for on-net traffic. Going forward, customers will gradually be transferred from  Telia’s to ice.net’s 4G-only network.    In the B2B segment, churn in the fourth quarter was above industry average following the migration process  from Telia’s to ice.net’s network. Churn has improved but is still not satisfactory. However, we are looking  ahead towards introducing new products and services in the B2B segment.    Our intent is to continue on the growth path in Norway – both in terms of customer acquisition and network  infrastructure build-out. To facilitate this, AINMT Holdings AB granted in December a subordinated  shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS of NOK 400 million with an initial disbursement of NOK  200 million and the second NOK 200 million disbursed in 2017. This will strengthen our ability to grab a  larger share of the Norwegian mobile phone market.       AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2016  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (10)  Significant events during the fourth quarter     On 28 December, following a fully subscribed NOK 800 million private placement and subsequent  share issue in AINMT AS and AINMT Holdings AB, AINMT Holdings AB granted a subordinated  shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS. The purpose is to fund further growth  ambitions in Norway - both in terms of customer acquisition and network infrastructure build-out.  The shareholder loan has a cap of NOK 400 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million,  and runs with 10 percent interest. The loan is subordinated to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS' high  yield bond (ISIN: NO0010705601).    Significant events after the end of the period     On 3 February 2017, ice.net in Norway announced that it in March would launch data roll-over for all  mobile phone consumer customers.

Any effects from business combinations are not included.  ** CAPEX is defined as investments in intangible and tangible assets as reported in the statement of cash flows.  For 2014 the CAPEX includes the acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    2015 was eventful, with important milestones met on the operational, financial and business development  side.     On the operational side, three major projects were undertaken in Norway this year. Firstly, the migration  of the Network Norway B2B portfolio was finalised early in the second quarter of 2015. This generated  churn as expected unfortunately, but we have seen steady growth in this segment starting from the end of  the third quarter of 2015.    Secondly, we launched our consumer smartphone proposition in Norway before the summer. The sales  rate following the launch and into the third and fourth quarter has proved that ice.net offers a highly  competitive product. We’re very pleased to have passed the 40,000 B2C mobile phone subscribers  already. This offers an excellent platform to build on throughout 2016 and beyond.    Thirdly, the mobile broadband network upgrade from 3G to 4G was successfully completed in the fourth  quarter. This converted the AINMT group into the sole 4G-only network provider across Scandinavia. The  focus is now on growing that segment again.    To capitalise on the many available growth opportunities, the group significantly strengthened its  financial capacity in the fourth quarter. A new subordinated PIK loan with par value of USD 120 million  was disbursed to AINMT Holdings AB early October, and USD 50 million was subsequently injected as new  equity capital in AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS.    On the business development front, the fourth quarter saw two major events. Firstly, the parent company  AINMT Holdings AB signed a definitive agreement to invest in Philippine 4G player Broadband  Everywhere. BE owns nationwide LTE frequencies in the Philippines. AINMT and its local partner will  invest funds to build a complementary 4G network providing wireless internet access for business and  residential customers as well as the M2M market. Secondly, AINMT Holdings AB also signed an agreement  AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2015  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (11)  to invest in PT Sampoerna Telekomunikasi Indonesia, which owns nationwide frequencies in Indonesia.  Together with its local partner, AINMT plans to continue to build and upgrade STIs wireless network.    In combination, the agreements in the Philippines and Indonesia have opened up a market of 360 million  potential customers for AINMT. Over time, the economies of scale from the presence in these markets will  also benefit AINMT’s Scandinavian operation.    Significant events during the fourth quarter     A new subordinated PIK loan with par value USD 120 million maturing in 2030 was disbursed to  AINMT Holdings AB early October and USD 50 million was subsequently injected as new equity in  AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS   Network upgrade in Sweden completed in October 2015   Network upgrade in Norway completed in November 2015   The High Yield bond in AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS successfully listed on Oslo Stock  Exchange on 10 November 2015    Significant events after the end of the period     Fine-tuning and optimization of the new 4G networks are being finalised during Q1 2016    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 138 versus 102 for the equivalent period  the previous year, including external resources however, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers  and subcontractors, the total number was 213 (126) people.    Investments    The Group’s cash flows from acquisition of intangible assets during the fourth quarter amounted to  NOK 647 (-) thousands. The corresponding numbers for the full year was kNOK 62,024 (716,867)  thousands, the major item being the acquisition of the business-to-business customer base from Network  Norway in February and access rights licenses in Sweden. For the comparison number the major item is  the acquisition of Ice Communication Norge AS that was awarded the spectrum licences in Norway in  December 2013.    Cash flows from investments in tangible assets during the fourth quarter amounted to NOK 247,633  (19,073) thousands and the corresponding numbers for the full year was NOK 510,556 (41,714)  thousands. These investments are mainly related to implementation of the new network and capacity  expansions, both on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    As a consequence of the 4G investments, the depreciations of the 3G related network components have  been significantly higher during 2015, and then finally scrapped as the new network was taken in use.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the fourth quarter amounts to NOK 108,637 (18,338) thousands  and the total year-to-date amounts to NOK 159,121 (27,808) thousands. The last quarter of 2015 was  heavily affected by extraordinary costs related to replacement of customer premises equipment and  related anti-churn activities in Norway and Sweden as part of the network technology upgrade.    AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Fourth Quarter 2015  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 3 (11)  The NOK 94.6 million net positive effect from the acquisition of Network Norway in February 2015 is not  included in the EBITDA.

DRAFT F                                                    ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS    FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 2017    Q4 2017  FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 2017                1  FOURTH QUARTER 2017 SUMMARY    ⁎ Service revenue of NOK 352,606 thousand; 33% y-o-y growth  ⁎ EBITDA* of NOK -111,102 thousand  ⁎ Book equity of NOK 523,198 thousand        CEO’s statement    ice group’s Scandinavian operation continues on the growth trajectory seen in previous quarters. Service revenues in  the fourth quarter increased 33% compared with the same quarter last year.     The overall performance of our Norwegian operation continues to be solid. In addition, it continues to challenge the  major players through launching new and innovative products. On 7 December, ice in Norway was the first operator  to introduce data rollover sharing – allowing customers to share excess data with any Norwegian ice customer of their  choice. The move was very well received amongst our customers in Norway.     Average smartphone on-net data traffic grew from 24% in the third quarter to 31% in the fourth quarter.     Following the migration of Hello’s B2C customers in October, churn increased somewhat. However, the ambition of  successfully moving across in excess of 40,000 customers was met. Churn returned to normalised levels after the  migration.    At the end of December, our Norwegian operation announced that it would change its brand name from ice.net to ice.  The brand change was successfully implemented early January 2018. Removing the “.net” and the wifi symbol from  its name and logo, and replacing it with an ice crystal, reflects the fact that network coverage in Norway is today a  matter of course and that customers should expect the same, excellent 4G network coverage with ice as with any  other operator. Ice wants to differentiate itself by how it treats its customers and how ice can make customers’  everyday life easier.     Subsequent to the quarter, on 6 February 2018, ice group’s Swedish operation (Net1) won the Swedish Post and  Telecom Authority’s frequency auction for the national license of 2 x 5 MHz in the 450 MHz band. The term of license  is from 5 March 2020 up to and including 31 December 2044. Obtaining the license until 2044 provides the  foundation we need to continue developing our mobile broadband offering in Sweden and continue our expansion in  the machine-to-machine market.       2017 2016 2017 2016 Service revenue * 352,606 265,239 1,241,917 859,204 EBITDA ** -111,102 -89,637 -463,021 -248,081 CAPEX *** -85,935 -167,216 -583,528 -487,035 Total assets 3,320,368 2,858,351 3,320,368 2,858,351 Operating margin % nm nm nm nm Equity/assets ratio % 16% 21% 16% 21% NOK thousands Fourth Quarter Jan - Dec ** ice group defines EBITDA as operating profit after adjustment of operating expenses for depreciation, amortization and  impairment losses, foreign exchange differences recognized in income pertaining to revaluation of items in the balance sheet  and non-recurring items.

Significant events after the end of the period  ⁎ Early January 2018, ice.net in Norway re-branded to ice.    ⁎ On 6 February 2018, ice group’s Swedish operation (Net1) won the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority’s  frequency auction for the national license of 2 x 5 MHz in the 450 MHz band. The term of license is from 5  March 2020 up to and including 31 December 2044. Netett Sverige AB will pay SEK 40.2 million for the  license.     Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 186 versus 153 for the equivalent period the previous  year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, the Group  employed 277 (259) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible and tangible assets during the fourth quarter amounted to NOK 85,912  (163,520) thousands. The corresponding amount for the full year was NOK 586,612 (338,130) thousands, whereof  NOK 75 million are related to the acquisition of the B2C customer base from Hello.    The investments are mainly related to the network smartphone migration project in Norway, both on existing and new  sites as well as on backbone systems and radio access network expansion.     Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK 23 (99) thousands, and for the full year the investments  amounted to NOK -3,084 (3,858) thousands.    EBITDA    Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the fourth quarter amounted to NOK 32,450 (11,121)  thousands and the corresponding amount for the full year amounted to NOK 70,732 (67,170) thousands. Non- recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade and Smartphone  migration. Please also refer to the section on Alternative Performance Measures on page 10.          FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 2017                3  Reclassification of commission revenue    Since the purchase of Network Norway business customers in March 2015, commission revenue and related  expenses have been recorded gross within service revenue and operating expenses, in line with the accounting in  Network Norway prior to being acquired by ice. Ice decided to change the accounting principle and instead recognise  the commission revenue net of expenses. The accumulated revenue impact for the year amounts to NOK -39,232   (-19,636) thousands. EBITDA and Net Result are not affected by this change. All comparative numbers have been  updated to reflect the change.    Risks and factors of uncertainty    Ice group Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings or its  financial position. These can be divided into industry, operational and financial risks; including regulatory and  competitive risks.    A material part of the ice group’s revenues and profits is derived from operations outside Norway. Currency  fluctuations may influence the reported figures in Norwegian Kroner. Please refer to the annual report of 2016 for a  detailed description of the risks identified.    Related party transactions    No related party transactions to report for the last quarter of 2017. For other items, see further details under the  section on critical accounting estimates and judgements in the annual report of 2016.    Outlook 2018    The company expects to increase its mobile phone (smartphone) market share and on-net traffic in Norway.

INTERIM REPORT 2013 INTERIM REPORT 2013 2 RESTAMAX Plc  INTERIM REPORT 21 FEBRUARY 2014 10 AM  RESTAMAX GROUP’S INTERIM REPORT FOR 1 JANUARY-31 DEcEMBER 2013  2013 in brief  In 2013, Restamax Group’s turnover increased  by 7.0 per cent. This growth was fuelled by the  growth investments made in 2012. In 2013, the  company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange   as planned.  The Group’s turnover was MEUR 65.0 (MEUR  60.8), growth 7.0 per cent. EBITDA was MEUR 9.1  (MEUR 9.9), decrease 8.0 per cent.  Operating profit was MEUR 4.1 (MEUR 5.7),   decrease 29.2 per cent.  The Board of Directors of the company proposes  that dividend be paid at EUR 0.09 per share.  October−December 2013 in brief  The general economic situation has been weaker  than forecast, and this affected sales in December  in particular. Due to December being weaker than  forecast, profitability decreased on the previous year.   The Group’s turnover in October−December was  MEUR 17.9 (MEUR 18.7), decrease 3.9 per cent.  EBITDA was MEUR 3.3 (MEUR 3.6), decrease 7.5  per cent.  Operating profit was MEUR 2.0 (MEUR 2.5),   decrease 17.0 per cent.  Prospects for 2014 The company estimates that 2014 turnover will  grow to MEUR 68–78. This growth is fuelled by  the business transaction completed with Hans  Välimäki in 2014 and the expansion projects on  which decisions had been made previously and  which will be realised during the first half of the  year. The 2013 turnover was MEUR 65.0. The com- pany estimates that the 2014 EBITDA will increase  to MEUR 10.5–12 as a result of operational ex- pansion and streamlining. The 2013 EBITDA was  MEUR 9.1. The company estimates that the 2014  operating profit will be MEUR 5.1–6.5. The 2013  operating profit was MEUR 4.1. The company es- timates that the earnings per share will increase  significantly.  Restamax Group’s turnover continued to increase  INTERIM REPORT 2013 3 2013 was both historic and successful year for  Restamax. Last November, Restamax became  the first Finnish listed restaurant company.  Restamax is a growth company, and the share  issue and listing were integral parts of our  growth strategy. Listing and the related share  issue make possible investments that bring the  company significant competitive advantage in  the future. A significant amount of these invest- ments will be realised during 2014 and 2015.  The operating environment in 2013 was rather  challenging even in the restaurant field. Over  the last years, the restaurant field in Finland  has grown approximately 3−4%, or somewhat  stronger than the gross national product. Al- though the general financial situation in Finland  continued to be unstable and costs continued  to climb, their effects on the company’s prod- ucts and their demand were relatively small.  Our operating environment is also significantly  affected by the debate ongoing at Parliament on  the alcohol legislation. The restaurant field is  a major employer in Finland and promotes the  employment of young people, especially. It is my  wish that decision-makers would take this into  consideration when discussing the alcohol policy  guidelines and taxation guidelines.  Despite the challenging general economic situ- ation, Restamax was able to maintain excellent  profitability, clearly above the average profit- ability of the field. The slight decrease in EBITDA  is explained by the unsuccessful theatre restau- rant concept launched in 2013. Another major  reason was the weaker than expected demand  during the festive season in December. Without  these factors, our EBITDA in the period under re- view would have been at the level of the previous  year. In addition to these factors, profitability  has been slightly affected by the investments  made in preparation for the listing. Our growth  speed in 2013 was slightly calmer than in the  previous years, as the company concentrated on  the listing project. For this reason, we did not  make significant new investments in 2013.  2014 will once again be a year of growth for  Restamax. The basis of operational growth and  profitability is in active product development  and innovation, competent staff, operative  accountability given to each unit and, on the  other hand, real-time guidance and monitoring  of operations. Centralised purchases as well as  the management of staff resources and goods  logistics are significant drivers for Restamax’s  profitability. Restamax can offer its customers  more extensive supply of restaurant services and  also boost its operations locally in terms of mar- keting, purchases and personnel management,  for example. Personally, I am also delighted by  the fact that our staff actively participated in the  initial public offering. This shows that Restamax  has strongly committed restaurant management  and staff.  This competent personnel will now be fully freed  from the 2013 listing process to implement the  company’s growth strategy. Restamax’s ap- proach aims to develop a range of restaurant  concepts to meet local demand and the provision  of premises. Restamax’s extensive restaurant  concept portfolio makes possible the achieving  of larger than before market shares in each city,  yet retaining the unique characteristics of each  establishment. The company’s extensive portfo- lio offers an entire chain of experiences, includ- ing café, restaurant and entertainment services  from early morning till late night.  Restamax actively studies potential corporate  transaction opportunities. We will use the equity  accumulated in the initial public offering to ex- pand business operations with corporate trans- actions supporting the growth strategy. Our aim  is the objective outlined by our Board of Direc- tors, turnover of MEUR 100 by the end of 2015.

The Group’s 2013 income  Restamax’s turnover for 2013 was MEUR 65.0  (MEUR 60.8), an increase of 7.0 per cent over the  previous year. The EBITDA was MEUR 9.1 (MEUR  9.9). The Group’s operating profit was MEUR 4.1  (MEUR 5.7).  The growth is mostly explained by the restau- rant investments made at the end of 2012, and  demand was also good over the past summer.  The company’s growth rate has been somewhat  slower than during the previous years, as during  the review period the company has focused on a  listing project and has therefore not completed  any significant new investments.  EBITDA decreased slightly from the same period  last year. One of the factors explaining the de- crease of the EBITDA is the unsuccessful theatre  restaurant concept the company launched in Jan- uary 2013. Without this launch, our EBITDA of the  period under review would have been at the level  of the previous year. In addition, profitability  has been somewhat affected by the investments  made in preparation for the company’s listing.  The Group’s operating net cash flow in 2013 was  TEUR 2,907 (TEUR 12,147).  Restamax has not made any significant corporate  acquisitions or growth investments during the  present financial period, due to its focus on the  listing process.  The Group’s interest-bearing net liabilities at  year-end were MEUR 6.2 in comparison to the  MEUR 6.0 at the end of 2012. The net financial  expenses in 2013 were MEUR 0.5 (MEUR 0.5). The  equity ratio was 60.9% (31 December 2012: 38.1  per cent) and gearing ratio 21.9 per cent (31   December 2012: 43.8 per cent).  Restamax sold its share of the advertising agency  Mainostoimisto Fuel Oy in August. At the same  time, the company made an agreement with the  advertising agency until 2015.  The company extended its operations in Rauma  and opened a nightclub called Panama Joe there  in August. A game restaurant called Space Bowl- ing & Billiard was opened in Tampere in Septem- ber 2013.  With a bill of sale signed on 27 September 2013,  the company purchased the Beefmax Oy shares of  a minority shareholder holding 24.68 per cent of  the shares. As a result of this transaction, Beef- max Oy became a fully-owned subsidiary of the  company.  The Group’s subsidiary JVP-Security Oy was sold  with a bill of sale dated 30 September 2013.  In October 2013, the company opened a restau- rant called Pub Hopeakenkä in Orivesi.  The premises of Gringos Locos and Celtic House,  operating in Seinäjoki, were renovated and  Daddy’s Diner and Galaxie Sport & Billiard were  opened on these premises.  The company renovated the business idea of the  nightclub operating in the Flamingo centre in  Vantaa.  In September 2013, the company listed on the  main list maintained by NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Oy.

Dividend, and dividend policy Restamax Plc’s distributable profits on 31 December 2014  were EUR 46,804,621.77, of which the share of the fi- nancial period is EUR 10,027,067.44. There have been no  significant changes to the company’s financial situation  since the end of the financial period. Restamax Plc’s Board of Directors proposes to the Annual  General Meeting to be held on 22 April 2015 that EUR 0.22  per share, a total of EUR 3,603,516.40 (16,379,620 shares),  be paid as dividend for the financial period ended on 31  December 2014 based on the adopted balance sheet. Restamax’s goal is to pay a competitive dividend each  year. When determining the dividend level, the amount  of distributable unrestricted equity, the company’s profit  development and future prospects are considered. Prospects for 2015 Profit guidance (as of 20 February 2015): Restamax estimates that the Group’s turnover will ex- ceed EUR 100 million during the 2015 financial period,  and the EBITDA and operating profit will relatively im- prove from the previous financial period. INTERIM REPORT 2014 3 Last quarter of 2014 met expectations   The growth speed of Restamax has been upbeat throughout  its history. The listing supporting our growth strategy and  the related share issue that took place at the end of 2013 have  made possible investments that bring significant competi- tive advantage; a large number of these were realised during  2014.  The last quarter of 2014 met expectations. Despite  the weak overall financial situation, the decline in the con- sumers’ buying power and loss of demand, we have managed  to retain our long-term profitability at a good level. Even  though we lowered our profit guidance in October due to the  poor September result, we achieved an excellent result this  year under rather challenging market conditions.  The strong growth of our Group resulted in more  non-recurring items than expected during 2014, some EUR  600,000 in total. These included expert fees, the integration  costs of the new labour hiring segment and asset transfer  taxes. The result was also affected by the indirect integration  costs of new business and the opening of new restaurants.  The general increase in the cost level also affected the invest- ments made more than was expected, and this in turn affect- ed operating income.  The business acquisitions made during 2014 were  completed during the past financial period, which means that  the purchased businesses are now fully available to us. The downturn of the business continued The restaurant business was in a downturn in 2014. The sale  of alcohol continued to decline and the growth in the sale of  food has slowed down. Customer behaviour is also undergo- ing a change. Customers are consuming less and their aver- age purchases are smaller than before.  A turn for the positive can be seen in the partial  reinstitution of deductible representation expenses that al- lows companies to deduct 50% of their representation ex- penses in their income taxation starting from the beginning  of 2015. This decision will support the demand for tourism  and restaurant services, increase employment and bring tax  revenues to the State.  Even though the restaurant industry is facing a  number of challenges, the future appears bright in the lon- ger term. I believe that the economic recovery and urban- isation will continue to increase demand for services in this  field. The tourism and restaurant sector creates a substantial  number of jobs and brings the State in excess of EUR 5 billion  in tax revenues each year. I hope that the decision-makers  acknowledge the importance of this sector and make good  decisions concerning the value added tax and alcohol taxa- tion in order to ensure the prerequisites for growth. ceo mArkkU vIrtAnen: A strong growth platform for labour hiring services The labour hiring segment became part of our activities in  August. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy will help us ensure  the sufficient availability of personnel in the future and  support the growth of our company. During the latter half  of the year, we made a number of changes, investments  and corporate arrangements in order to integrate the new  segment into our activities. Labour hiring will remain a  substantial part of our business, and the actions taken  now will form a strong growth platform for the future. Motivated personnel and comprehensive partner  network I am rather pleased with the level of commitment and  operation of our personnel in 2014. The personnel re- sources that were released due to the listing are now fully  available to us. During the last quarter we made a num- ber of successful changes in the Executive Team that will  support the implementation of our future growth plan.  On 1 March 2015, Vice CEO Harri Niskanen will join us in  developing our activities. His valuable professional ex- pertise will strengthen the leadership of our Group.  The significance of our partners has also in- creased further. We have expanded our partner network  and boosted the cooperation with our contract suppliers. Supplementing the restaurant portfolio During the period under review, we expanded our opera- tions towards the growing tourism centres in Ruka and  Pyhä by opening five restaurants. We also added three  new nightclubs into our portfolio. The purchase of the  Apollo and Tivoli nightclubs expanded our operations  into Oulu, a new market area; in Pori, we strengthened  our current market position by purchasing the Cabaret  nightclub. We also strengthened our cooperation with  Hans Välimäki by opening the August von Trappe Bel- gian restaurant in Tampere; in early 2015, this restaurant  chain expanded into Helsinki. Today, our Group com- prises approximately 100 restaurants in different parts  of Finland.  Despite the challenging general economic situa- tion, we were able to maintain good profitability in 2014;  it was clearly above the average profitability within the  industry. Our goal is to maintain good profitability and to  exceed a turnover of MEUR 100 during the 2015 financial  period. It seems that our turnover goal will be met clearly.

RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT 1 JANUARY – 31 DECEMBER 2015 TURNOVER INCREASED BY OVER 31 PER CENT AND  PROFITABILITY IMPROVED IN JANUARY–DECEMBER 2015 INTERIM REPORT 2015 DIVIDEND Restamax Plc’s distributable funds on 31 December  2015 were EUR 47,931,699.32, of which the share of  the profit of the financial period is EUR 5,233,008.84. There have been no significant changes to the  company’s financial situation since the end of the  financial period. Restamax Plc’s Board of Directors proposes to the  Annual General Meeting to be held on 27 April 2016  that EUR 0.27 (0.22) per share, a total of EUR  4,422,497.40 (16,379,620 shares), be paid as dividend  for the financial period ended on 31 December 2015  based on the adopted balance sheet.  PROSPECTS FOR 2016 Profit guidance (as of 23 February 2016): Restamax expects the consolidated turnover to  increase and profitability to remain on a good level  in the 2016 financial year. The company’s goal is to reach a turnover of MEUR  180 by the end of 2018. INTERIM REPORT 2015 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN 2015 went as planned In January−December 2015, the turnover of our Group  increased by more than 31 per cent, EBITDA by nearly  38 per cent and operating profit by 38 per cent in  comparison with the previous financial period. The last quarter of 2015 positively exceeded our  expectations. In November we specified our profit  forecast and increased our turnover estimate from  MEUR 100 to some MEUR 110. Our expectations were  fulfilled and our turnover for the 2015 financial year  was MEUR 113.6. We also forecast that EBITDA and  operating profit would improve relatively in comparison  to the previous financial period. Our profitability   improved significantly, which is evident in the EBITDA,  and there was also improvement in operating profit. In the restaurant business segment, the pre-Christmas  party season was rather successful and the consumption  of our company’s restaurant services was creditable at  the end of the year. The good result was made possible  by our wide and diverse restaurant portfolio, which  offered customers plenty of choice from food  restaurants to game and entertainment centres.  In October−December, we opened the Hollywood  Bowling & Billiards entertainment centre in Jyväskylä,  as well as the Academy 32 nightclub targeted at  young adults. We strengthened our positions in  Tampere by acquiring a majority shareholding in  the popular restaurant Hook. In Oulu, we opened  the Viihdemaailma Ilona nightclub and the Sticky  Wingers chicken wings restaurant, and in Ruka the  Alpine-spirited Les Alpes restaurant. We also bought  a majority shareholding in Hernesaarenranta Oy,  which engages in the restaurant business at  Hernesaari in Helsinki, and we acquired a minority  shareholding in SuperPark Oy, which operates indoor  activity parks.  In the labour hire business segment, the result of a  successful pre-Christmas party season was affected  by the bankruptcy of a customer company of our  labour hire subsidiary Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy,  as a result of which our company suffered a write-off  totalling €700,000 in the review period. In spite of  this write-off, we were able to stick to the statement  we had given, even though the write-down hindered  the development of our operating profit. New strategic goals guiding operations During the past financial period, we achieved a  turnover of MEUR 100, which our Board of Directors  had set as our long-term target in 2013. In December 2015, we published the new long-term  financial targets set by our company’s Board for  the strategy period 2016−2018. It is our intention to  expand our restaurant business abroad, both through  company acquisitions and organically. At the same  time, we will also continue our profitable growth in  Finland in the restaurant and labour hire businesses. Our turnover target for 2018 is MEUR 180. EBITDA  and operating profit are expected to remain on a good  level. Many of our restaurant concepts are exportable and  can be established abroad. We are actively studying  different markets in order to integrate ourselves into  new markets abroad, while continuing our strong  growth in Finland in both business segments. Swimming against the current in  a general economic downturn The tourism and restaurant industry has gone  through its fourth difficult year. 2015, however,  was slightly better than expected for companies  in the sector. An economic review compiled by the  Finnish Hospitality Association (MaRa) based on  an economic barometer published in January 2016  by the Confederation of Finnish Industries EK says,  however, that companies in the sector will continue  to experience an economic situation that is weaker  than average. Economic prospects have brightened  a little, but remain very modest. In the coming  months, however, sales figures are expected to show  small growth. According to an estimate by MaRa,  during the next five years investments in the tourism  and restaurant business will reach one billion euros,  INTERIM REPORT 2015 which indicates confidence in the recovery of the  sector.  In recent years, the average growth in turnover for  the tourism and restaurant industry has been about  one percentage point and the annual change in GDP  volume has even been negative. In spite of the poor economic situation, we have  increased our turnover and improved our result  considerably more strongly than the general market  trend. At the time of our stock exchange listing in  2013, our turnover was MEUR 65. Two years on, it is  more than MEUR 113, representing growth of nearly  75 per cent. We have therefore almost doubled our  turnover during our time as a listed company, and at  the same time we have been able to maintain good  profitability. Our success is based not only on our competent and  committed staff, but also on our dozens of different  restaurant concepts, which can be tailored to suit  different locations. We listen to consumers and the  market and are constantly developing our business.  In that way, we can keep our restaurant portfolio  interesting. The market clearly exists and, through  our efficient operating models, we have achieved  exceptionally strong market profitability and growth  over a long period of time. The efficient operations of the restaurant business  are indicated by, for example, our staff expense  percentage of 28.5, which is excellent. This enables  efficient operating models for our subsidiary Smile  Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy, for example. A significant youth employer in society With its turnover of over MEUR 24 in the last finan- cial year, the labour hire business has grown rapidly  into an increasingly important part of our Group,  and a basis for comparison for its development has  gradually formed.  According to the Private Employment Agencies’  Association HPL, the overall turnover of the   employment agencies’ sector, which is developing  rapidly, is constantly growing. The demand for  labour hire and the volume of part-time employment  are growing strongly. From the point of view of youth  employment in particular, the role of the labour hire  sector in our society is significant.  The share of people under the age of 26 working in  the tourism and restaurant industry is as much is  30 per cent. The workforce of our subsidiary Smile  Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy, one of the major operators  in the labour hire sector, numbers more than 3,200  people, 59 per cent of whom are under the age of 26.  Because of this, we are a significant youth employer  in Finland. The business of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut has been  dominated by the restaurant sector, but growth  opportunities are seen in many other sectors too,  such as healthcare and trade. In the near future, we  will particularly be seeking strong growth in labour  hire in the retail sector. The liberalisation of retail  opening hours can be seen as a positive opportunity  in this sector. Future brighter than the general market trend In the near future, we expect a reform of the Alcohol  Act. The Government’s so far unimplemented plans  to cut Sunday and overtime pay would also have been  positive news for our industry. In the future, we hope  for good decisions from the government to boost  employment in the sector. Through the legislative  reforms, Finnish drinking and restaurant culture will  have better conditions to develop and diversify. In spite of the challenges set by the general  economic situation and legislation, every year we  have succeeded in growing our business. At the same  time, we have been able to maintain good profitability,  which is clearly above the average profitability within  the industry. Strong development in our earnings  per share has also taken place. We believe that our profitable business and growth  will continue despite the prevailing market situation.  The targets set for 2015 have been achieved, and we  strongly believe that we will also reach the long-term  targets in the coming strategy period. Markku Virtanen, CEO

RESTAMAX INTERIM REPORT 1 JANUARY–31 DECEMBER 2016 TURNOVER INCREASED BY 14.5 PER CENT AND  PROFITABILITY IMPROVED IN JANUARY–DECEMBER 2016 INTERIM REPORT 2016 DIVIDEND On 31 December 2016, Restamax Plc’s distributable  assets were EUR 53,026,343.97, of which the share  from the profit for the financial period is EUR  6,814,342.05. There have been no significant changes  to the company’s financial situation since the end of the financial period. Restamax Plc’s Board of Directors proposes to the  Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2017  that EUR 0.30 (EUR 0.27) per share, a total of EUR   4,985,886.00 (16,619,620 shares), be paid as dividend  for the financial period ended on 31 December 2016  based on the adopted balance sheet. PROSPECTS FOR 2017 Profit guidance (as of 21/02/2017): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  and profitability to remain on a good level in the 2017  financial year. The company’s goal is to reach a turnover of MEUR  180 by the end of 2018. INTERIM REPORT 2016 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Growth in line with strategy in the 2016 financial  period In January−December 2016, the turnover of our  Group increased by 14.5 per cent, EBITDA by 17.3 per  cent and operating profit by almost 24 per cent in  comparison with the previous financial period. 2016  supported our strategic growth: we strengthened our  present marketplaces and expanded our operations  northwards. Although the final quarter of the year did not com- pletely meet our growth expectations in terms of  the restaurant business, we can be satisfied with the  figures for the 2016 financial period, which are quite  good compared to the sector in general. Our 2016  turnover was MEUR 130.1, EBITDA MEUR 19.4, and   operating profit MEUR 9.0. We succeeded in improving  the sales and material margin in the restaurant  business, and in reducing staff costs. Turnover in October–December 2016 increased by  more than 9 per cent in comparison with the pre- vious year. Our comprehensive restaurant portfolio  with its diverse concepts and top-class artists offered  customers tailored events and exciting moments. At  the same time, the flexible and customer-centred   service of our staff and their quick reactions in  changing situations were the cornerstones of our   efficient operations. An active end to the year ensured  that our staff were busy throughout the country. A difference from the corresponding quarter in 2015  was, however, a later start to the Christmas party  season – the consumption of services did not sig- nificantly pick up until the end of November. The  result for October 2016 was considerably weaker than  the previous year, which was also generally evident  throughout the tourism and restaurant sector. When  examining October, it is also justifiable to compare  it to the same month in 2015, which contained five  weekends. The clear focusing on December of 2016  Christmas party sales is partly a result of there being  five weekends in December. Also, Christmas sales  were boosted by Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday,  as a result of which a reduction in customers going  home to their families the weekend before Christmas  was not yet noticeable. Towards the end of the year, we strengthened our  positions in the North and in the Helsinki area.  In November, we bought the Colorado Bar & Grill  restaurants in Ruka, Levi, Pyhä and Helsinki, the  Mura Sushi restaurant in Ruka and the Kuura and  Pizza Block restaurants in Levi. In East Ruka, we also  opened Vuosseli, a new family pizzeria. In November–  December, opening parties were held in Helsinki for  Wayne’s Coffee Lönkka and Wayne’s Coffee Lauttis,  which operate on the franchising principle. In the  same way, the eighth restaurant of the Classic  American Diner concept began operations in  Citykäytävä in Helsinki at the beginning of   December. Success fuelled by the ability to adapt to trends In 2016, clear themes were evident in the restaurant  industry. According to a trends survey of restaurant  dining published in December 2016 by the Finnish  Hospitality Association (MaRa), customers value  fast, high-quality and convenient food as shown, for  example, by the growth in takeaway culture, cafés,  pizzerias and hamburger restaurants. At the same  time, lunchtime dining in restaurants has decreased  and moved more towards the evenings and leisure  time. All in all, the share of adults and young adults  regularly visiting restaurants and cafés is increasing  in Finland. Trends that emerged in the survey are also clearly  perceptible in our Group’s events in 2016. During  the year, we concluded a cooperation agreement  with, among others, Wolt and Foodora home delivery  services and the Lunchie service that aims to reduce  food waste from restaurants. Also the 2016 financial  period, we opened the hamburger-oriented Classic  American Diner restaurant at the Jumbo shopping  centre in Vantaa, at Linnanmäki and in downtown  Helsinki, the pizzeria Bella Roma in Jyväskylä, the  chicken wings restaurant Hook, two Wayne’s Coffee  cafés in Helsinki and the Vuosseli pizzeria in Ruka. We  continuously monitor consumer behaviour and the  INTERIM REPORT 2016 market, and adapt our concepts and services to the  wishes of the customers. Growth in the tourism and restaurant sector  slows towards the end of the year – recovery  on the horizon  According to an economic forecast published by MaRa  in February 2017, the turnover of the tourism and  restaurant sector increased by 4.9 per cent between  January and November 2016 and that of restaurants  by 4.7 per cent. According to MaRa’s seasonal survey,  about 60 per cent of companies increased their sales  during the Christmas party season. According to  a turnover forecast, in the last quarter of 2016 the  turnover of restaurants increased by 3.4 per cent,  even though growth in the January–November period  was 4.7 per cent. The slowing of growth is based on  the exceptionally bad October, when turnover growth  in the sector was just 1.8 per cent. Generally speaking, the economic situation of the  sector has improved but is still below average. The  companies in the tourism and restaurant sector,  however, have an optimistic attitude to the future.  According to MaRa, restaurant food sales will continue  to increase and the decline in sales of alcohol will  continue. All in all, an increase in purchasing power  has continued thanks to slow price development, and  consumer confidence has increased to the highest  level in five years. If the new bill announced in November 2016 con- cerning a new Alcohol Act enters into force in 2018,  in spite of the previous positive forecasts it will also  present challenges for the restaurant sector. According  to MaRa, the most problematic points include the  strict requirement for doormen relating to the exten- sion of licensing hours and permitting customers to  bring their own alcohol to restaurants available for  hire, which may ultimately weaken the profitability  and employment situation for restaurants. According to MaRa, the sector will grow rapidly in   the coming years. A challenge will be, however,   difficulties with recruitment, which are already  evident, particularly in restaurants’ seasonal needs.  Through our subsidiary, Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy,  we have the possibility to prepare for the changing  staffing needs of the different seasons and to react  efficiently to changing situations. Business of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut continues  strongly The labour hire segment was successful in 2016 and  turnover climbed to MEUR 34.1. Although growth  was strong, the level of profitability remained good.  Compared to the previous financial period, turnover  increased by over 41 per cent, EBITDA by almost 60  per cent and operating profit by over 106 per cent.  In the final quarter of 2016, turnover increased by  nearly 30 per cent from the previous year, EBITDA  by almost 189 per cent and operating profit by over  3,700 per cent. The segment’s EBITDA percentage,  which in 2016 was more than 10 per cent, is quite  good for the sector. The successful acquisition of new customers and the  positively growing business of our customers have an  impact on the segment’s result for the review period.  Turnover continued to increase in the restaurant  sector, and we significantly strengthened our posi- tion in our new areas of industry, construction and  health care. The purchase of a majority holding in  Ostrobothnia-headquartered Make My Solutions Oy  (MMS Henkilöstöpalvelut) in April 2016 also increased  our volume. During the third quarter of 2016, we also  launched a system- and process development project,  the aim of which is to simplify and streamline the  company’s operating practices. The labour hire sector is a significant employer and  an area of future growth. According to the Confeder- ation of Finnish Industries, in comparison with the  previous year, the total turnover of the labour hire  sector increased in November 2016 by 20.3 per cent,  and the turnover of labour hire services by 20.2 per  cent, over the previous year. The cumulative turn- over for the period January–November 2016 was more  than MEUR 773, an increase of 14.4 per cent over the  previous year. Our development is proceeding in line  with the favourable prospects of the sector, although  our growth is substantially stronger than the average  development for the sector.

There have been no significant changes to the  company’s financial situation since the end of the  financial period. Restamax Plc’s Board of Directors proposes to the  Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 April  2018 that EUR 0.33 (0.30) per share, a total of EUR  5,484,474.60 (16,619,620 shares), be paid as dividend  for the financial period ended on 31 December 2017  based on the adopted balance sheet. PROSPECTS FOR 2018 Profit guidance (as of 20 February 2018): In accordance with its strategy, Restamax expects  the Group’s turnover to increase and profitability to  remain on a good level in both segments in the 2018  financial year. The restaurant segment is expected to  reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 140 and in  labour hire a turnover of approximately MEUR 110 is  expected, the total turnover being some MEUR 240  after eliminations. Restamax’s goal is to reach a turnover of approxi- mately MEUR 400 by the end of 2020 after internal  eliminations. The goal of the restaurant segment is to  reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 200, and the  goal of the labour hire segment is to reach a turnover  of approximately MEUR 220 by the end of 2020. INTERIM REPORT 2017 Continues on next page A record year for growth We have a strong year of growth behind us. During   January−December 2017, the turnover of our Group  increased by almost 43 per cent, EBITDA by 15.5 per  cent and operating profit by almost 20 per cent in  comparison with the previous financial period. Once  again we reached our long-term strategic goals and,  during 2017 we already exceeded the turnover target  of MEUR 180 that we set for 2018.   In 2017, we served up to 7 million customers and our  restaurant portfolio grew from 110 to more than 130  restaurants. Although the second and third quarters  of 2017 were challenging, which affected our EBITDA  and EBIT margins, we were able to keep our key effi- ciency figures, such as our staff expenses and mate- rial margin, at a good level. The final quarter of the year was quite successful  and culminated in the busiest-ever Christmas party  season. In October–December, we opened more than  10 new restaurants and, despite their opening costs,  we succeeded in catching up with the results of the  second and third quarters that were influenced by  poor summer weather. We continued to strengthen  our position in our familiar market areas, and opened  restaurants in new cities, Vaasa and Rovaniemi.  Increased focus and additional investment in sales,  marketing and streamlining operating practices  improved customer flow and increased average pur- chase. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy’s rate of growth  accelerated as a result of corporate acquisitions, and  the company became a leading player in the field. A busy Christmas party season creates confidence  in the recovery of the restaurant industry Although chilly summer weather halted the growth  of restaurants seen early in the year, the situation  brightened up towards the end of the year – the  Christmas party season was the best for years for the  whole restaurant industry. According to the Finnish  Hospitality Association (MaRa), in the period Janu- ary–November 2017 the turnover of the tourism and  restaurant industries increased by 5.5 per cent. The  economy strengthened during the autumn and, ac- cording to forecasts, the growth in Finnish GDP was  about 3.2 per cent in 2017. Consumer confidence also  strengthened towards the end of the year and, in  January 2018, rose to the highest in its history. The reform of the Alcohol Act, which partially en- tered into force in January 2018, is a much-needed  boost for the industry, and will allow happy hour  marketing, among other things. The Act, which will  be fully implemented at the beginning of March  2018, will also make extended opening hours possible.  We will utilize the reform in our operations, and we  believe that it will both strengthen customer flows  and increase the average size of customer purchases.  The reform will also play a significant role both in our  own restaurant operations and in the development of  the whole sector. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut one of the major players  in the sector 2017 was also a record year for our labour hire busi- ness. The turnover of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut  increased over 121 per cent from the previous year,  EBITDA by almost 92 per cent and operating profit   by 140 per cent. The growth in customer purchases  has been positive, and the acquisition of new cus- tomers successful. The corporate acquisitions of  Banssi Henkilöstöpalvelut, Job Services One and  Active People carried out during the year spurred on  the company’s growth, which is clearly faster than  that of the market. The growth of Job Services One,  currently operating under the name of Smile Job  Services Oy, clearly exceeded our expectations, and  its positive result is booked as a non-recurring earn- out item of MEUR 1.7 in the financial expenses of the  segment’s review period. Capital transfer taxes re- sulting from corporate acquisitions (EUR 300,000) also  affected the result. By the end of 2020, Smile will be  targeting a turnover of MEUR 220. During 2017, Smile strengthened its position particularly   in the construction, industrial and logistics sec- tors. Smile’s organic growth has been supported by  strong investment in marketing and brand work.  CEO JUHA HELMINEN INTERIM REPORT 2017 Continues from previous page Implementing a new IT and the integration of ac- quired companies into the business will be completed  early in 2018, as a result of which operations will be  harmonised and made more efficient than ever. At  the end of 2017, Smile also established Smile Educa- tion Oy, which provides training services, in particu- lar focusing on producing training and recruitment  services for graduating students with the aim of  improving the availability of manpower for custom- ers. During 2018, Smile will invest in its corporate  management culture, organisational expertise and  the development of new digital services. As a result of an increase in demand for financial and  labour hire services, the market looks very positive.  In 2017, labour hire was Finland’s strongest growing  sector – the number of employees increased by more  than 10 per cent over the previous year. In January–  November 2017, the labour hire sector in Finland  achieved a turnover of MEUR 1,163.6, 18 per cent up  on the previous year, and turnover in labour hire ser- vices climbed to more than MEUR 978.5, an increase  of 23 per cent over the previous year. Expanding beyond Finland and new targets In 2017, we enjoyed the strong confidence of investors  and the market. The development of our share price  was stronger than ever before, rising from the year  end 2016 level of approximately EUR 6 to above EUR 8.   Kauppalehti ranked Restamax as the 14th most prof- itable listed company, based on its gross yield of 49.1  per cent. During 2018, we will expand our restaurant business  abroad. Our main focus area will be Northern Europe  where the restaurant market is fragmented, so we  see enormous potential in it. There are three models  for our expansion: corporate acquisitions, export- ing our own concepts and a hybrid of the two. We are  currently in active negotiations in several countries  outside the borders of Finland. At the end of 2017, we published new long-term  financial goals and strategy. Our goal is to reach a  turnover of approximately MEUR 400 by the end of  2020. Active work to reach these goals has begun.  In January 2018, we announced that we would be re- vamping our organisation and management. We will  invest more strongly in the management of business  units, the boosting of acquisitions and in the satis- faction of our customers and staff. We will, for exam- ple, expand the opportunities for training provided  by Restamax Academy for our staff. Sales, marketing  and market knowledge will be given increasing value  in our operations, and for this we will strengthen our  Executive Team during the spring with a Chief Com- mercial Officer (CCO).

We have reviewed the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Össur hf. and it’s subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002, and  the related Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the period then ended.  These interim Consolidated Financial  Statements contain Income statements, Balance sheets, Statement of Cash Flows and Notes to the Financial Statements.  These  Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to issue a report on these  Financial Statements based on our review.    We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards applicable to review engagements.  Those  standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Financial Statements are  free of material misstatement.  A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied  to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit.  We have not performed an audit and, accordingly, we do not  express an audit opinion.     Based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Financial Statements  do not give a true and fair view of the financial position of Össur hf and it’s subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002, of the results of  their operations and their cash flows for the period than ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  applied on a consistent basis.  Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries have been reviewed by Deloitte & Touche in the  countries where they are located.
