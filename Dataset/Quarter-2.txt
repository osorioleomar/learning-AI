The operating profit for a rolling twelve-month period at the end of the second  quarter was SEK 99m (64), representing a rise of 55 percent. The operating profit in  Sweden increased by 46 percent compared with the first half-year 2006. Investments  in growth in the UK and Denmark have burdened the operating margin. Expansion in  Germany has similarly put pressure on margins.    Sales  Sales for German operations rose by 24 percent in the first half-year compared with  the same period last year. The equivalent rate of increase for Baltic and Eastern  European operations, through the partly owned subsidiary Webmedia, was 64  percent while sales in Finland increased by 15 percent. Twelve consultants have  been recruited in Denmark since operations were started in March 2007. In the UK,  a further eleven people have been recruited in addition to the twelve who were  already employed at the time of the acquisition in March 2007.    In total, operations outside Sweden represented 28 percent of the Group's  consolidated sales for the first half-year 2007. Growth in Sweden for the first half- year 2007 was 13 percent, composed of a combination of acquisitions and organic  growth. All non-Swedish subsidiaries are deemed to be able to maintain good growth  rates, and sales within the non-Swedish part of the Group are expected to increase.        INTERIM REPORT   1 January – 30 June 2007              ACANDO AB (publ) 3 (15)  www.acando.com  SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF-YEAR 2007    (SEK million) Sweden 2)  Germany Webmedia Other  countries  3)  Group  elim.

Growth in Sweden for the first half-year 2007 was 13 percent with sales of SEK  498m (439), while the operating profit improved by 46 percent to SEK 44m.    Capacity utilisation has been good and rose in the first half-year. Price levels have  been stable or have increased slightly. There is considerable competition for  experienced consultants within the sector, which has led to a rise in both the inflow  and outflow of employees. Acando continues to significantly need to recruit  consultants within many areas of expertise. These needs are satisfied to a certain  degree through sub-consultants.    Operations within Deva Management Consulting, which was acquired in the first  quarter, have been successfully incorporated with the other Swedish operations.    Demand for consultants is expected to continue to be good in the second half-year  within all business areas and at all operating units. Growth is primarily governed for  the moment by the ability to attract, recruit and retain employees.       INTERIM REPORT   1 January – 30 June 2007              ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (15)  www.acando.com  Germany  Profits in Germany have been burdened by considerable recruitment and consultant  costs. The offices in Hamburg and Frankfurt have generated good profit levels. The  office in Bremen has also contributed positively to results in Germany. The office in  Düsseldorf, which reported a loss in the first quarter, has reversed the trend and  generated a profit in the second quarter.    New customers include the World Economic Forum (Switzerland), the Kuoni travel  agency, Bosch Siemens Hausgeräte, Hapag Lloyd and Beiersdorf.     Acando entered into an agreement with TietoEnator in the second quarter for the  taking over of a number of consultants in Hamburg, as well as the customer  contracts that these consultants work with. The consultants are specialised within  the SAP ERP system. Employment contracts have been signed with 16 consultants.    A branch was established in Switzerland in the second quarter with the objective of  creating a local presence for our customers.    Baltic Region and Eastern Europe (Webmedia)  Webmedia has experienced good demand in the Baltic Region with an increase in  sales to SEK 41m (25). The operating profit was SEK 5m (2), representing an  improvement of 150 percent.    Sales have increased strongly in Estonia and Lithuania, particularly within the  telecom and finance sectors where Hansabank and Estonian Mobile Telecom  constitute two significant customers. Demand from Sweden (near-shoring) is  growing as a consequence of the shortage of consultants in the Nordic countries.  Focus has thereby moved from previously being only on low prices to demand for  qualified IT expertise.    Other countries  The company in Finland contributed positively to the Group's consolidated earnings  in the second quarter, while the units in Denmark and the UK – which are both in a  building-up phase with significant investment in the recruitment of consultants – had  an equivalent negative effect.    Denmark: The development of the newly started operations in Denmark continues as  planned. Acando's strategy is to become a leading player within SAP and systems  development where the availability of consultants from Acando's subsidiary in  Estonia forms an important part of the delivery. Since starting up in March, Acando  in Denmark has recruited twelve consultants with considerable experience within  ERP systems, and the rate of recruitment is expected to continue to be high during

Comparative figures are affected by the consolidation of the acquired companies Deva  Management as of 1 February 2007, former IQ Consultancy Ltd in the UK as of 1 March 2007,  and former Abeo Gruppen A/S in Norway as of 1 October 2007.       OPERATIONAL TRENDS PER GEOGRAPHIC MARKET    Sweden  The turnover for the first half-year 2008 was SEK 542m, compared to the same period last year  SEK 498m, an increase of 9 percent. The operating profit for the first half-year 2008 was SEK  53m, compared to the same period last year SEK 44m, an improvement of 20 percent.    The turnover in Sweden increased during the second quarter with SEK 28m to SEK 272m.  The  operating profit increased during the same period with SEK 7m to SEK 24m, an increase of 41  percent. The operating margin was 8.8 percent (6.8).      The demand for consultancy services was strong in the first half-year, with subsequent good  capacity utilization. Price levels have been stable or have increased slightly. Acando continues  to need to recruit consultants within many areas of expertise. These needs are satisfied to a  certain degree through sub-consultants. Due to the high demand, there is considerable  competition for experienced consultants within the sector, which has led to a high rate of inflow  and outflow of employees. However, the turnover rate has been reduced during the second  quarter.     During the past quarter a new three year agreement was signed with Volvo for a delivery of  consulting services in Europe. The agreement also pertains to collaboration partner Sopra  Group, with head quarters in Paris, which already delivers services to Volvo (former Renault).  Both Acando and Sopra are versatile and strong global suppliers to Volvo. Acando also  cooperates with Sopra Group in other areas, for example in projects for EADS, which is a major   INTERIM REPORT             1 January – 30 June 2008            ACANDO AB (publ) 5 (5)  www.acando.com  customer for both consultancy companies.

The turnover in Germany during the second quarter was SEK 89m an increase of 36 percent  compared to the same period last year. The operating profit was SEK 6m (2).     Results have been burdened by a provision for a doubtful trade receivable of close to SEK 2m,  as previously reported, implying that the entire amount has now been covered.     Norway  The turnover in Norway for the first half-year 2008 was SEK 72m. The operating profit for the  first half-year 2008 was SEK 8m, after joint group costs.    The turnover during the second quarter was SEK 36m. The operating profit of SEK 4m  corresponds to an operating margin of 11 percent.    On 28 September 2007, Acando acquired all shares in the Norwegian company Abeo Gruppen  A/S, which has changed name as of 1 January 2008 to Acando Gruppen A/S. Demand for  consultancy services was good during the period, and operations are stable.

CEOs COMMENTS Acando’s broad customer base, and the co-operation between consultants from different geographical markets and offerings, has sustained the same level of resource utilisation as during the first quarter 2009. The price levels have been stable, even though some effects have been noted because of re- negotiated frame agreements. In addition, some reduction in the demand has also been noted, which results in an increased competition for new assignments. INTERIM REPORT 1 January – 30 June 2009 ACANDO AB (publ) 2 (16) www.acando.com The first half-year was represented by a combination of new shorter assignments with short pay- off times for the customers and an increased demand for comprehensive engagements. However, the decision processes regarding the latter is somewhat extended compared to other kind of assignments, which results in an extended lead-time when consultants go from one project to the other. This, in its turn, affects the utilisation rate, which is somewhat reduced compared to the first half-year 2008. In combination with the reduction in personnel, which has been executed according to plan in some segments to adjust to a change in demand, the net sales and operating profit has been affected negatively, compared to the same period previous year. The second quarter consisted of three working days less compared to the same period previous year. This affected both the revenues and the operating profit for the second quarter with approximately SEK 15m. However, the first half-year 2009 has the same number of working days as previous year. “My experience of Acando is that every colleague is focused on creating sustainable customer value in each and every assignment. In addition, when talking to customers, I hear that Acando and its personnel have a focus on delivery and are sensitive to customer needs. All in all, we have a very strong position to continue develop from” says Carl-Magnus Månsson, who commenced as CEO of the Acando Group as of 1 June 2009. Acando adjusts continuously to the current and changing market conditions through an adjustment of the organisation and improved efficiency. At the same time Acando secures its position for future growth by developing its offerings and a portfolio of re-useable solutions components. Acando’s broad customer base and geographical presence strengthens the possibility to act in an uncertain market environment. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN SUMMARY Acando received very high quality ratings from its customers and was significantly better than the average of its peers, according to the Swedish Quality Index (SKI) in June 2009. SKI is a system to measure and analyse how the customers and other stakeholders value goods and services in Sweden. Acando has signed a number of contracts for application management of customers’ business critical systems during the first half-year 2009, among others Tibnor and Westinghouse. Acando has previously signed contracts with e.g. Helse SørØst RHF and Norstedts Juridik regarding similar services. Acando’s business area of Application Management is growing continuously. INTERIM REPORT 1 January – 30 June 2009 ACANDO AB (publ) 3 (16) www.acando.com As the market in western Sweden changed dramatically during the winter 2008/2009, the company adjusted both capacity and offering to the changing demand by reducing the number of consultants in the region. In total 40 employees from the Gothenburg office have terminated their employment, in accordance with the notice given on 4 February 2009. Restructuring costs of SEK 20m have reduced the result for the first half-year 2009. Additional costs in connection with the continuous adjustment of the organisation have affected the result, but are not reported as restructuring costs. The annual general meeting in April 2009 decided to pay a dividend of SEK 0.50 per share, according to the board of directors’ proposal. Acando's Employee Stock Option Program 2006/2009, which was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2006, is currently in its exercise phase. As a consequence of the exercise of allocated employee stock options, the share capital of Acando has during June 2009 increased from SEK 98,205,961 to SEK 99,271,706, corresponding to 852,596 new B-shares and an equal amount of voting rights. The convertible debenture loan 2006/2009, of SEK 25m, was redeemed fully in June 2009, i.e. no conversion to shares was exercised. THE ACANDO GROUP SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS Acando has a strong financial position with a good cash flow and high solvency (68 percent). The turnover per consultant is in line with previous year. SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF-YEAR 2009 Consolidated net sales for the Group amounted to SEK 792m (833).

 INTERIM REPORT     January 1 – June 30, 2010   Price-sensitive information that is reported   to the Financial Supervisory Authority     *No tax expense was charged against earnings in 2009     1 (17)          INTERIM REPORT     JANUARY 1 –JUNE 30, 2010    Second Quarter – April 1 – June 30, 2010   Net sales: SEK 375 m (383)   Operating profit: SEK 15 m (17)   Operating margin: 4.0 % (4.4 %)   Profit after tax: SEK 9 m (17*)   Earnings per share after dilution: SEK 0.11 (0.22*)  January 1 – June 30, 2010   Net sales: SEK 735 m (792)   Operating profit: SEK 34 m (39). Restructuring costs  of SEK 20 m were charged against earnings in the  preceding year.   Operating margin: 4.6 % (4.9 %)   Profit after tax: SEK 24 m (38*)   Earnings per share after dilution: SEK 0.31 (0.49*)   Cash and cash equivalents: SEK 47 m (153)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  A gradually strengthening demand situation with an increasing number of large projects during the first six months of the  year, indicates that the market will develop favorably during the second half. Overall, price pressure diminished  somewhat, although competition for major assignments remained significant. Sweden showed favorable development  with a somewhat higher operating profit compared with the same quarter in the preceding year. In Sweden and Norway,  additional costs for completion of three major customer projects started in 2009 or earlier were charged against earnings,  while earnings in Germany were affected by increasing price pressure. It was gratifying to note that our operations in  Finland and the UK are growing with favorable profitability.  Acando’s strategic focus of combining in-depth business knowledge with a focus on generating profits with the help of IT,  proved successful. We secured several large projects relating to business improvements and system roll-outs based on SAP  and Microsoft. We also established a new solution area for mobile support for maintenance of geographically distributed  environments and added yet another major customer in the second quarter.  Our work with Microsoft as a technology partner continued successfully. As proof, Acando became a member of the  Microsoft Dynamics President’s Club 2010 following several successful Microsoft Dynamics CRM projects. Recruitment  continued to meet demand in this area, and during autumn 2010, an Acando Academy program will start in which young  talents will be given an opportunity to combine consulting assignments with in-depth training in Microsoft’s solutions.  The positive market development and improved order bookings in several countries during the second quarter create  prerequisites for growth and improved profits during the second half of the year. Thus far this year, we have employed  slightly more than one hundred persons within expansive competence areas. A number of these recruits will assume their  positions during the third quarter. At the same time, staffing was adjusted in areas where we foresee weaker demand.   INTERIM REPORT    January 1 – June 30, 2010          ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (17)  www.acando.com  Significant events during the quarter    In April 2010, Acando signed an agreement with Sopra  Group regarding the use of an established offshore  center in Noida, India. Acando thus gains access to cost- effective delivery capacity with broad expertise, which  further strengthens its offering to customers in Europe.  During the second quarter, the partnership had already  resulted in a number of projects and project requests  with a supplier mix from Acando and the offshore center.    Market development    The improved demand situation that started the year  continued during the second quarter in Sweden, Norway,  Finland and the UK. Several major projects were started,  although there is still strong competition and the  associated price pressure in such projects. However, the  general fall in prices has diminished and prices have  stabilized. The overall assessment is that these markets  will develop positively during the second half of 2010. In  the German and Danish markets, demand remained  weak and price pressure continued.  Customers and offering    During the second quarter, demand increased for  services relating to both business development and  strategic IT. The focus among Acando’s customers is  gradually shifting from cost rationalization and increased  efficiency to improving market positions and innovation.  The SAP area developed well in terms of utilization.  Acando continued to secure assignments for both  implementation of new solutions and refinement of  existing ones. The delivery strategy with small,  experienced and efficient teams is gaining confidence  among customers and is a critical factor in choosing  Acando.  Interest for solutions based on Microsoft technology is  growing both within the area of Business Intelligence,  with SharePoint as the foundation, and within Dynamics.  The ability to combine business knowledge with in-depth  understanding of applications established a unique  position in the market.  During the second quarter, Acando secured a number of  large orders:   In May 2010, Acando received an order from Swedish  Match for implementation and roll-out of Microsoft’s  Dynamics AX business system, including an industry- specific solution for process industries. The solution also  includes integration with systems of external partners  and proprietary systems via Microsoft BizTalk Server.   In June 2010, Perstorp selected Acando as the  implementation partner for a roll-out of its SAP solution  in the UK. This partnership already included a  maintenance assignment for Perstorp’s SAP system.   In June 2010, Acando received an order from a Nordic  service group relating to licenses and implementation of  the proprietary solution Mobile MIS for mobile  maintenance, inspection and service. The solution  supplements SAP with functionality for integrated  mobility.    Net sales and profit    April – June 2010  Net sales and operating profit for the second quarter of  2010 are presented in the table below.    Consolidated net sales for the second quarter amounted  to SEK 375 m (383). The net decline of SEK 8 m was  primarily attributable to German operations and negative  currency effects mainly related to the EUR.

Profit after tax amounted to SEK 9 m (17). Earnings  per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.11 (0.22), a  decline of 50 percent. In comparing, it should be noted  that no tax expense was charged against earnings in  2009.  January – June 2010    Net sales and operating profit for the period from  January to June 2010 are presented in the table below.    *Operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs  of SEK 20 m.  Consolidated net sales for the first six months of 2010  amounted to SEK 735 m (792). Of the net decline of SEK  57 m, about 40 percent was attributable to currency  effects mainly relating to the EUR. The actual volume  decline was principally attributable to Germany.         Operating profit amounted to SEK 34 m (39),  corresponding to an operating margin of 4.6 percent  (4.9).      Profit after tax amounted to SEK 24 m (38). Earnings  per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.31 (0.49), a  decline of 37 percent. In comparing, it should be noted  that no tax expense was charged against earnings in  2009.  The corporate tax recognized as an expense in the  income statement in the first six months of 2010  comprised the sum of current tax costs for the period and  the net of reversed and capitalized tax assets. The  company had unutilized loss carry-forwards totaling SEK  415 m, which are deemed possible to utilize over the  coming years and will thus have a positive effect on cash  flow. The Group recognized deferred tax in an amount of  SEK 105 m, which was included as a financial asset in the  balance sheet. This asset will decrease in pace with  utilization of loss carry-forwards.  Profit trend per quarter  Net sales and operating profit per quarter for the period  from April 2008 to June 2010 are shown in the diagram  below.    Operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs  of SEK 20 m.  Consolidated net sales in the second quarter showed  growth for the third consecutive quarter. This growth  was primarily related to organic growth in Sweden,  Finland and the UK and acquired sales in Denmark. This  confirms that the demand situation has gradually  improved.     The operating margin was negatively affected by the  weak earnings trend in Germany and Denmark and  additional costs for completion of three major customer  projects in Sweden and Norway.

Sweden    In Sweden, utilization gradually improved during the first  half of 2010, and demand in all competence areas  increased.     Operations in the Stockholm region showed increased  order bookings and favorable utilization during the  second quarter. The Gothenburg region remained the  most successful region in Sweden with strong growth  and favorable profitability. The Malmö office continued  to show low utilization and order bookings. A new  regional manager was appointed in June, and changes  were initiated in order to improve profitability.  The diagram below shows the development of net sales  and operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  for the period from April 2008 through June 2010:      Operating profit in the first quarter of 2009 included restructuring costs  totaling SEK 20 m and costs totaling SEK 4 m in the second quarter for  isolated changes in personnel composition.    Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 were in line with  2009 and amounted to SEK 219 m (220). In comparison  with the first quarter of 2010, it can be noted that net  sales increased by about 6 percent. Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 12 m (11), an increase of about 6  percent. The operating margin for the first six months of  2010 increased by 1.4 percentage points, compared with  the preceding year. Overall, operations in Sweden  accounted for 58 percent of the Group’s net sales during  the second quarter of 2010, which was in line with the  corresponding period in the preceding year.      Examples of major customers during the period  included AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Vattenfall and Volvo.     Germany    Demand in Germany remained weak also during the  second quarter. In procurements for framework  agreements and projects subject to competition,  increased price pressure was noted. Following intensified  sales efforts, a recovery of utilization was noted,  compared with the low level at the beginning of the year.  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin per quarter for German operations  during the period from April 2008 through June 2010.    Net sales during the second quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 77 m (97). Of the total decline of SEK 20 m, slightly  less than half was related to negative currency effects  mainly related to the EUR.

Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, HanseNet and Deutsche Telecom.  Norway    During the second quarter, the market situation  improved somewhat in Norway, and utilization gradually  increased. Acando further strengthened its position as an  advisor within strategic IT in the public sector through a  number of new projects and framework agreements.  The graph below shows the development of net sales and  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from April 2008 through June 2010.  Net sales during the second quarter of 2010 amounted to  SEK 41 m (41). Net sales were also unchanged in local  currency.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 1 m (4), corresponding to an operating  margin of 3.5 percent (9.8).      Operating profit for the first six months amounted to  SEK 2 m (7). Profit was negatively affected by guarantee  commitments in  a major customer project.  Examples of major customers during the quarter were  Politiets data og matrielltjeneste and Helse Sr st.  After the end of the period, Acando signed a three-year  framework agreement with the Church of Norway  relating to information and business architecture. The  order value during the contract period amounts to about  NOK 20 m.    Other countries    Finland: Finland continued to develop favorably with  satisfactory profitability during the second quarter of the  year. New recruitment and increased sub-consultant  volumes contributed to growth. Several new customer  commitments extended Acando’s offering in the Finnish  market. Examples of major customers during the quarter  were Veho and Altia.  Denmark: Denmark was characterized by weak demand  and strong price pressure. The action program initiated  during the first quarter gradually showed effects. During  the latter part of the quarter, utilization increased, while  cost levels were reduced. Examples of major customers  during the quarter included Banedanmark and  TeliaSonera.  UK: The UK showed increased sales and increasing  margins during the second quarter. The focus of  operations remained on deliveries of advanced program  managers to AstraZeneca.     -15,0% -10,0% -5,0% 0,0% 5,0% 10,0% 15,0% 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Q2  2008 Q4  2008 Q2  2009 Q4  2009 Q2  2010 Net sales Operating margin SEK m

     INTERIM REPORT     January 1 – June 30, 2011    Price-sensitive information that has to be reported   to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (18)        INTERIM REPORT  JANUARY 1 –JUNE 30, 2011    Second quarter - April 1 – June 3o, 2011   Net sales SEK 385 m (375)   Operating profit SEK 25 m (15)   Operating margin 6.5% (4.0%)   Profit after tax SEK 17 m (9)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.22 (0.11)      January 1 – June 30, 2011   Net sales SEK 783 m (735)   Operating profit SEK 59 m (34)    Operating margin 7.5% (4.6%)   Profit after tax SEK 40 m (24)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK 0.53 (0.31)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK 106 m (47)    Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO    Bolstered by strong overall demand in all geographic areas and fields of expertise, the operating margin improved 2.5  percentage points year-on-year. The Swedish operations remained the Group’s source of momentum and delivered well in  terms of margins, both in Gothenburg and in the Stockholm region, although there is room for further improvement.  Operating margins in Germany and Norway also improved compared with the same period in 2010, but have yet to reach a  satisfactory level given the favorable market scenario.     In a strong market, the competition for highly skilled consultants also increases. This has led to a higher personnel turnover  than in 2010. Increased personnel turnover caused a lower utilization ratio due to more time spent phasing consultants in and  out of projects, which in turn had an adverse impact on earnings. The healthy demand scenario has resulted in Acando  continuing to recruit employees to all areas of expertise.     In early July, meaning after the close of the quarter, we divested our Danish consulting operation. Despite intense efforts to  restructure the operation, it has not performed as planned, which resulted in continued operating losses. Denmark accounted  for 1 percent of the Group’s sales during the first half of 2011. Our focus remains on markets in which we have the ability to  deliver our full set of offerings or where we foresee clear international customer projects or expertise synergies.          INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (18)  www.acando.com  Market development    The second quarter was marked by the same high demand  in Sweden, Germany and Norway as in the first quarter.    The willingness to invest in the private sector remains high,  particularly in the manufacturing industry.     Prices experienced a slightly positive trend overall.     Customers and offering  Business system and CRM-related implementations  continue to trend well, both in the SAP and Microsoft area.  A number of major ongoing procurements indicate  continued strong demand.     The demand for Microsoft solutions based on Sharepoint  is considerable, which has led to shortages in the market  for Sharepoint skills.        In Germany, the partnership between Acando and  ForgeRock is proceeding favorably. The companies jointly  deliver solutions for identity and access management  based on open source codes. As a ForgeRock partner,  Acando delivers consulting services in the integration area  and training services to the German market.     During the second quarter of 2011, Acando secured several  major orders, including:     In May 2011, the children’s rights organization Plan  Sverige selected Acando as its supplier of the  Microsoft Dynamics business system.   The Municipal Council Secretariat in Oslo has decided  to introduce a new portal for publicly elected officials  tasked with managing the electronic distribution of  documents. Acando in Norway is to deliver the  technical solution for this portal based on Liferay.    In May 2011, The Norwegian Association of  Authorized Accountants opted to use Acando to  implement Microsoft Sharepoint for a new document  management system to support the organization’s  quality control of member firms.  Net sales and profit  April – June 2011  Net sales and operating profit for the second quarter of  2011 are presented in the following table:    Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of 2011  amounted to SEK 385 m (375), representing growth of  about 3 percent. The strengthening of the SEK, mainly in  relation to the EUR, had a negative impact on total growth  by approximately 3 percentage points.     Operating profit totaled SEK 25 m (15), which represents  an increase of 67 percent compared with the second  quarter of 2010. The operating margin rose 2.5 percentage  points to 6.5 percent (4.0). The improvement in the margin  was primarily attributable to increased operating profit in  Sweden. The second quarter of 2010 was charged with  additional costs related to the completion of three major  customer projects in Sweden and Norway.     Profit after tax amounted to SEK 17 m (9). Earnings per  share after dilution doubled to SEK 0.22 (0.11).    January – June 2011   Net sales and operating profit for the period January  through June 2011 are shown in the following diagram:    Consolidated net sales in the first half of 2011 amounted to  SEK 783 m (735), up 7 percent.

Operating profit was SEK 59 m (34), corresponding to an  operating margin of 7.5 percent (4.6).      Profit after tax totaled SEK 40 m (24). Earnings per share  after dilution were SEK 0.53 (0.31).    Quarterly earnings performance      Net sales and operating profit per quarter for the period  April 2009 through June 2011 are shown in the following  graph:   Net sales in the second quarter of the year were slightly  lower than in the first quarter of 2011, which was primarily  attributable to fewer working days. Prices experienced a  slightly positive trend overall as a result of a favorable mix  of assignments and some price increases in new projects  and agreements.     Development of operations by geographic market    Introduction    Net sales and operating profit distributed by geographic  market are presented in the following table:        Sweden    The Swedish market was characterized by continued  strong demand during the second quarter of the year. A  weak positive trend was noted in terms of average prices.  An increased inflow of inquiries concerning the  implementation of business systems based on SAP and  Microsoft has resulted in a favorable utilization scenario  ahead of the rest of 2011.     The Strategic IT competence area continued to perform  well, with high utilization and increasing prices. Volume  growth was strong, fuelled by many assignments on a  short-term basis.     In the major metropolitan areas, the competition for  qualified employees continued to intensify, resulting in  high personnel turnover. Recruiting activities remain  prioritized and subcontractor volumes increased to meet  demand. However, this resulted in somewhat lower  operating margins relative to staffing using in-house  personnel.        2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 221 219 20 12 8,9% 5,4% Germany 78 77 3 1 4,5% 1,0% Norway 46 41 2 1 4,3% 3,5% Other countries 44 44 -1 1 -1,3% 3,3% Group adjustments -4 -6 1 0 - - Total 385 375 25 15 6,5% 4,0% April-June   2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 SEK m Net sales Net sales Operating  profit Operating  profit Operating  margin Operating  margin Sweden 444 427 43 29 9,6% 6,8% Germany 156 156 7 3 4,8% 2,0% Norway 98 80 7 2 6,9% 2,0% Other countries 92 79 1 1 1,6% 1,3% Group adjustments -7 -7 1 -1 - - Total 783 735 59 34 7,5% 4,6% January-June 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Q2  2009 Q4  2009 Q2  2010 Q4  2010 Q2  2011 Net sales Operating profit Operating margin SEK m  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (18)  www.acando.com  The graph below shows the trend in net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for Swedish operations  during the period April 2009 through June 2011:    Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 amounted to SEK  221 m (219), corresponding to growth of 1 percent.    Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  amounted to SEK 20 m (12), up 67 percent. The operating  margin rose 3.5 percentage points to 8.9 percent (5.4). The  increase in profit was primarily attributable to the  improved market conditions, higher demand and improved  project profitability.     Overall, operations in Sweden generated 57 percent (58)  of the Group’s net sales during the second quarter of 2011.      Examples of major customers in the period were  AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Volvo and Stockholm County  Council.      Germany    During the second quarter, a certain weakening in the pace  of demand increases was noted in the German market.  Demand varies between the areas of expertise. Microsoft  and Java skills remain in demand, while the demand for  SAP expertise is lower.      The exposure to a few major customers was reduced in  2011 as a number of new customer relationships were  established and advanced.     The following graph shows the trend of net sales and the  operating margin per quarter for operations in Germany  during the period April 2009 through June 2011:  Net sales in Germany remained at the same level year-on- year at SEK 78 m (77). However, the SEK strengthened on  the EUR and in local currency, the operation reported  growth of about 8 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  strengthened to SEK 3 m (1), with an operating margin of  4.5 percent (1.0).     Examples of major customers during the quarter were  EADS/Airbus, Vattenfall, HSH Nordbank and comdirect  bank AG.     0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 0 50 100 150 200 250 Q2  2009 Q4  2009 Q2  2010 Q4  2010 Q2  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m 0,0% 2,0% 4,0% 6,0% 8,0% 10,0% 12,0% 14,0% 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q2  2009 Q4  2009 Q2  2010 Q4  2010 Q2  2011 Net sales Operating margin SEK m  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2011             ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (18)  www.acando.com  Norway    Despite a strong demand scenario, the price level in  Norway remained unchanged. Acando’s customer base is  primarily found in the public sector where prices are  governed by competitive framework-agreement  procurement processes.      High demand also entailed increased personnel turnover,  which in turn resulted in a slight decline in the utilization  ratio caused by set-up times in project transfers.      The partnership between Sweden and Norway, aimed at  building a strong position as a supplier of Microsoft-based  solutions, is progressing well and includes the possibility of  cross-border deliveries.     The graph below shows the trend in net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Norwegian operations  during the period from April 2009 through June 2011:  Net sales in the second quarter of 2011 totaled SEK 46 m  (41), corresponding to growth of approximately 13 percent.  In local currency, growth amounted to approximately  19 percent.     Operating profit for the quarter, including Group costs,  improved to SEK 2 m (1) and the margin rose to 4.3 percent  (3.5), which was attributable to a higher degree of  utilization and improved project profitability.     Examples of major customers during the period were  Norway's National Police Computing and Material Service  (PDMT), NAV and DnB Nor Bank (Vital).       Other countries    Finland: Finland once again reported a strong quarter. The  order scenario was favorable and included assignments  from both established and new customers.      Examples of major customers during the quarter were  Altia, Cargotech and Veho.    Denmark:  The Danish operation continued to report  operating losses despite the restructuring actions taken.    The operation was divested in early July 2011. Also refer to  the description in the Events after the close of the  reporting period segment.    UK: The UK demonstrated continued robust growth.  Operational focus remains on deliveries of advanced  program management services to AstraZeneca in the UK  and abroad. In 2011, a number of new customer  relationships have also been established based on the  existing service offering.  The graph below shows the trend for net sales and the  operating margin per quarter in Other countries during the  period April 2009 through June 2011:      Net sales by operations in Other countries during the  second quarter of 2011 remained unchanged at SEK 44 m  (44). In local currency, growth totaled about SEK 3 m,  meaning that negative currency effects were  approximately SEK 3 m. Growth in local currency in Finland  was slightly more than 25 percent and nearly 50 percent in  the UK.

     INTERIM REPORT  January 1  – June 30, 2012     Price-sensitive information that has to be reported      to the Financial Supervisory Authority          1 (20)        INTERIM REPORT    Second quarter, April 1 – June 30, 2012   Net sales SEK 408 m (385)   Operating profit SEK 29 m (25)   Operating margin 7.0% (6.5%)   Profit after tax SEK 21 m (17)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK  0.29 (0.22)        Accumulated, January 1 – June 30, 2012   Net sales SEK 816 m (783)   Operating profit SEK 63 m (59)   Operating margin 7.7% (7.5%)   Profit after tax SEK 45 m (40)   Earnings per share after dilution SEK  0.63 (0.53)   Cash and cash equivalents SEK86 m (106)        Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  During the first half of the year, our business performed well with continued growth and an improvement in year-on-year  earnings. All segments were strengthened, which resulted in increased operating profit for the Group. Sales were driven by a  continued stable sub-consultant volume and improved utilization rates. Earnings were positively impacted by favorable  utilization rates during the quarter in several of our major markets, as well as by somewhat higher prices resulting from a  strong mix of projects and specialist transactions. Our aim to manage a significant share of our deliveries in clear project  assignments, with distinct and brief iterations, enables us to ensure that we will meet customers’ expectations while also  optimizing our utilization rate. The fact that our customers are given the opportunity to make decisions concerning continued  investments during the course of the project has become a clear success factor and given us a solid reputation among our  customers.    In Sweden, we continue to foresee a strong trend in all areas of delivery – Management Consulting, Business Systems and IT  solutions. Specifically, we have noted that greater clarity in our Management Consulting offering with a focus on sustainable  operational improvements has generated a strong earnings trend driven by several exciting assignments among new and  established customers. To satisfy strong demand, we have focused on recruitment. During the second quarter, we recruited  about 80 individuals, most of which will assume their positions during the forthcoming third quarter. We have also noted that  our work with providing consultants with a relevant development has generated tangible effects in the form of lower staff  turnover.   In our operations in Germany and Norway, we continued to experience stable demand for our services and the utilization rate  improved somewhat compared with the first quarter. This has contributed to strong profitability and we intend to continue to  change our assignment and customer mixes to further improve profitability.    In Finland, we confirmed our position as one of the most expert SAP implementers by being entrusted with implementing SAP  All-in-One for the Alma Media Group. By using SAP expertise from throughout the Group, we have the ability to offer  sufficient size, proven methodology and unique specialist skills through all phases from the process definition to management.   We have a positive outlook on the remainder of the year, with continued strong demand. Our focus is on creating sustainable  improvements in every assignment, which will lead to new assignments and the need for more of the best consultants.       INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (20)  www.acando.com   Significant events    Second quarter, 2012  During the second quarter, Acando in Sweden entered into a major agreement with Fora for support and management of their  SAP environment. Meanwhile, a five-year framework agreement was signed concerning SAP consulting and project services.     Significant events after the end of the period  In early July, Acando signed an agreement with the Finnish media Group Alma Media concerning the delivery of Alma Media’s  new financial system. Acando will deliver a solution based on the comprehensive and flexible business system, SAP Business  All-in-One. The objective is to simplify Alma Media’s financial management, improve its financial controls and enhance its  process efficiency. The short implementation period will provide Alma Media with a quick return on its investment.     Business activities    Market development  During the second quarter, all markets in which Acando is active experienced a demand scenario that was in line with the year- earlier period. No direct impact of the weaker macroeconomic climate or currency uncertainty was noted, although the  national conditions vary. All geographic locations experienced a stable price level, in which project-based procurements and  framework-agreement renewals also had margins for somewhat higher prices concerning specific skills. Major projects also  continued to have somewhat longer decision-making processes, although no year-on-year difference was noted.     Customers and offering  In the IT solutions area, portal solutions for information management, document management and communications  continued to grow. Acando delivers projects based on a number of technical platforms, including Microsoft Sharepoint, Liferay  and First Spirit.    Strategic IT remains a key element of our offering portfolio. Based on several major framework agreements in Norway and  Sweden, Acando regularly delivers advanced advisory services to the public sector and major global companies. The  proportion of public-sector architectural assignments is growing, although we have also noted increased interest in the  harmonization and efficiency enhancement of IT environments among midsized companies.     In the business systems area, the demand for SAP remains the greatest concerning advancements and regular improvements  to pre-implemented systems. Accordingly, Acando’s combination of operational consultants and SAP consultants with in- depth technical knowledge enables it to provide effective and rapid actions. In addition, increased volume was noted for  inquiries regarding the replacement of older ERP systems. The CRM area also continues to grow and several minor projects  were secured during the quarter. A combination of business system understanding and CRM system knowledge is often  required to achieve full implementation force, which Acando can provide.     Acando is one of the first SAP suppliers in the Nordic region to become Partner Center of Expertise certified. The certification  is given in two parts: SAP Business All-In-One and SAP BusinessObjects and Acando has been certified in both. The  certification enables Acando to provide support services for the business systems it sells and is necessary to continue to sell  SAP licenses in Sweden and Finland.    INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2012     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (20)  www.acando.com  Net sales and profit    Second quarter, April – June 2012  Net sales and operating profit for the second quarter 2012 are shown in the table below:        Consolidated net sales for the second quarter 2012 amounted to SEK 408 m (385), representing growth of 6.1 percent.

The town  is located on Borðoy, which is one of the northernmost islands.  The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not  before the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern  Faroese town that became the cultural and commercial centre for the Northern  Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksvik is located between two inlets  lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a  modern fishing fleet.

The town  is located on Borðoy, which is one of the northernmost islands. The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not  before the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern  Faroese town that became the cultural and commercial centre for the Northern  Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksvik is located between two inlets  lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a  modern fishing fleet.  With the opening of the sub sea tunnel, the  Norðoyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksvík is physically linked with the mainland of  the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports.   SUMMARY OF Q2 2013  MARKETS AND SALES  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  SEGMENT INFORMATION  GROUP FINANCIALS  INVESTMENTS 2013-2017  OUTLOOK Page 4BAKKAFROST / Q2 PRESENTATION 2013 BAKKAFROST  – THE LARGEST FISH FARMING COMPANY IN THE FAROE ISLANDS ~ 1 1 0 k m  Largest salmon farming company in the Faroe Islands  ~67% of harvest volumes in Q2 2013  50% of farming licenses  Harvested 10,540 tgw in Q2 2013 (10,219 tgw in Q2 2012)  Feed sale of 18,196 tonnes in Q2 2013* (20,762 tonnes in Q2 2012*)  Revenues of DKK 610 million in Q2 2013 (DKK 416 million in Q2 2012)  Operational EBIT of DKK 169 million in Q2 2013 (DKK 78 million in Q2 2012)  Positive results from Farming and Feed, loss on VAP  Dividend of DKK 2 per share (NOK~ 2.04) paid out in May 2013 *) Including internal sale of 14,412 tonnes in Q2 2013 (12,376 tonnes in Q2 2012) Page 5BAKKAFROST / Q2 PRESENTATION 2013 SUMMARY OF Q2 2013 Margin  Strong results – Group Operational EBIT DKK 169m  Farming EBIT/kg NOK 19.34  Fishmeal, Oil and Feed 12.30% EBITDA margin  VAP negative EBIT/kg of NOK 8.80 Market  Strong salmon prices and reduced supply in Europe  High demand on large salmon Operation  Harvested same volume as in Q2 2012  Transferred 1.8 million smolts in Q2   Biology good and stable

The consolidation with Connecta will make us the leading  management and IT consulting company in Northern Europe. The merged company will have a key position in the Swedish  market. We will gain clear leadership in the areas of Management Consulting, Strategic IT, Business Systems, both SAP and  Microsoft Dynamics, as well as a completely new opportunity to assume responsibility for customers’ digital transformation,  from strategy to solution development. The merger will also result in further depth in several sectors and solution areas, as well  as access to expertise in several new technical platforms, such as Google and Oracle, which will generate new expansion  opportunities.  We will also have the opportunity for deliveries from the Baltic region and India, as well as access to  infrastructure-based services. All in all, we will become a more full-service provider, with additional depth and cutting edge  within our three principal areas, Management Consulting, Enterprise Solutions and Digital Solutions, but also with more  complete contents. Integration is progressing according to plan, with primary focus on shared customer processing and  coordination of the service offering, as well as the realization of other synergies. The cost advantages indicated in the prospectus  have been validated and realized largely in the second half year, with restructuring costs as a consequence.  During the second quarter, earnings in the Swedish and German operations improved at the same rate as in the first quarter.  The market in these countries remained unchanged with some uncertainty with respect to major investments. In Norway, the  market for general technology services weakened and during the quarter, earnings were charged with the implementation of  efficiency enhancements in connection with the final integration of E-vita. In Finland, we experienced a weak market with  extended decision cycles, which had an adverse impact on capacity during the quarter, while the operation in the UK continued  to develop with stronger profitability.   The market for our services is characterized by an increasing number of projects with higher demand for both operational and  technological insight and consequently increased the demand for listening when implementing changes jointly with our  customers. Access to new technology is generating new solution potential and completely new opportunities in business  modelling and process development. One such example is our collaboration with NetOnNet to provide a real-time visualization  of the key performance indicators for pricing and profitability to enable price adjustments through a sophisticated decision- support system.  To achieve success, we must understand our customers’ own prerequisites and strategies, the industry in which they are active  and the potential for the technology to accelerate the change processes. To cope with this, we must continue to create a clear  position, in which we combine implementation focus with strategic insight. At the same time, we must continue to expand to  satisfy an increasing number of customers with demand for more complex projects and cooperation over a complete lifecycle,  from strategy definition to application management. An example of this is the trust placed in us by Orkla to jointly implement  an SAP implementation in several parts of the group. Another example that demonstrates the importance of having knowledge  and insight into a specific industry or sector is the success we achieved in our investment in member-based organizations, in  which another major trade union decided to use our “Medlem 2020” framework to modernize its support system and enhance  the efficiency of its processes.     INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (22)  www.acando.com  I am confidently looking forward to the autumn, particularly the strength that will arise when Sweden’s best consultants meet  and face challenges in both ongoing and new assignments. We have now taken a new position in our ambition to provide our  customers with a faster path to success.    Significant events      Second quarter, 2014  In a press release on June 9, 2014, Acando announced a recommended public takeover bid for the shares in Connecta AB (publ),  in which Acando offered shareholders of Connecta ten new Series B shares in Acando for every three existing shares in Connecta.  After the end of the period on June 10, Acando decided to proceed with the Offering since it had received more than 90 percent  support. Connecta will be consolidated into the Acando Group from August 1, 2014.    During the second quarter, Acando in Sweden was commissioned to introduce a business support system for member  management and notification for one of Sweden’s largest trade unions with a corresponding unemployment insurance fund.  The agreement pertains to Acando’s Medlem 2020 solution, which includes Sharepoint, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and AX.    Acando will become the implementation partner to Orkla Shared Services in the roll-out of SAP in several of the divisions of the  Orkla Group. The implementation will be conducted in close collaboration with Orklas’ internal SAP organization.     During the quarter, Acando in Norway signed an agreement to deliver intranet for the auditing company BDO, which has more  than 1,000 employees and a large office network in Norway.    Acando has once again been awarded membership of the Microsoft Dynamics President Club. On a global level, only 5 percent  of all Microsoft’s Dynamics partners qualify for this award. Acando is one of Microsoft’s largest implementation partners of  Dynamics CRM and Dynamics AX in the Nordic region and received membership thanks to strong growth, high quality delivery  and customer focus.    Significant events after the end of the period  In early July, Acando held an Extraordinary General Meeting. The Meeting resolved to issue 34,624,516 new Series B shares in  Acando as payment for the Offering to shareholders in Connecta.     On July 10, Acando decided to proceed with the Offering to Connecta’s shareholders, while a decision was made to extend the  acceptance period until July 21, 2014, to give shareholders who had not yet accepted the Offering the opportunity to do so.     To ensure continuity and in accordance with the merger agreement, two members of Connecta’s Board of Directors were  offered co-opted positions in Acando’s Board of Directors until the next Annual General Meeting. Mikael Nachemson and  Caroline af Ugglas accepted the offer.      INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (22)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Market development  Demand in Sweden and Germany is in line with the first quarter; however, investments in major projects remained slightly  cautious. Some weakening in demand in Norway for general technology expertise was noted and a continued weak trend in  Finland. Long-term demand remained favorable, driven by digital transformation and completely new application areas for  technology in business processes.         Customers and offering    The need for industry-specific knowledge and experience is becoming increasingly clearer, both in Management Consulting and  Business Solutions. Accordingly, Acando includes experience in both solutions and analysis methods for more rapid  implementation and execution, but also as a unique way to integrate analysis and solution development between Management  Consulting and Business Solutions.     Demand for SAP and MS Dynamics remains favorable, in terms of new implementations, upgrades and continued expansion of  applications.    General increase in demand for Strategic IT, particularly connected to issues pertaining to integration and control of more  component-based architectures, with features of cloud-based solutions.           INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2014     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (22)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Second quarter April – June 2014  Net sales and operating profit for the second quarter of 2014 are shown in the table:    Consolidated net sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 388 m (371), with growth of 4 percent compared with the year-earlier  period.  Operating profit was SEK 6 m (11), corresponding to an operating margin of 1.6 percent (3.0). Operating profit includes costs  totaling SEK 2.2 m connected to the acquisition of Connecta, as well as restructuring costs of SEK 4.4 m in Norway. Before  extraordinary expenses, operating profit amounted to SEK 12.6 m and an operating margin of 3.3 percent. Consolidated profit  after tax was SEK 5 m (8). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.07 (0.12).          Accumulated January – June 2014  Net sales and operating profit for the first six months of 2014 are shown in the table below:      Consolidated net sales amounted to SEK 789 m (737), with growth of 7 percent compared with the year-earlier period.   Operating profit was SEK 33 m (30), corresponding to an operating margin of 4.2 percent (4.0). Before extraordinary     expenses, operating profit amounted to SEK 39.6 m and an operating margin of 5.0 percent. Consolidated profit after tax  totaled SEK 26 m (22).

In terms of work, the fourth quarter is the most work  intensive with the highest number of working days. The  third quarter is always lower due to vacation.  The industry in which Acando operates is late-cyclical and a  weak market impacts with a delay of about one quarter. The  same applies when the market turns.        Development of operations by geographic market    Introduction  Acando is a management and IT consulting company that, in partnership with its customers, enhances and streamlines  processes, organizations and IT. Acando has approximately 1,100 employees allocated over 19 offices in five countries. The head  office is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Operations in Sweden account for about 53 percent of operations followed by Norway  with 19 percent and Germany with 18 percent. The remaining 10 percent is accounted for by operations in Finland and the UK,  which are reported together under the heading Other countries.        Sweden  A strong trend in the Stockholm region was noted during the quarter, while Gothenburg, Malmö and Mälardalen reported  slightly weaker performance. Capacity in Stockholm is driven primarily by a number of larger projects that utilize expertise from  several delivery areas in Management Consulting, Business Solutions and Digital Solutions. In Gothenburg, a certain amount of  caution was noted among major industrial customers, which generated slightly weaker capacity.    The increased commitment in SAP implementations in the Orkla Group that was announced during the quarter entails a  favorable utilization rate for the SAP area in the autumn. At the same time, several other projects are in progress and new ones  are starting up, which has generated a continued recruitment need in the area.     An increasing number of administration assignments in both Microsoft Dynamics and SAP means that the proportion of long  projects in the portfolio is growing. A successful coordination of the delivery models between several areas meant that  profitability is also increasing gradually and the customer-rated quality remains high.    During the quarter, new projects and higher commitments in the area of Strategic IT, with a focus on primarily control and  establishment of roles in IT management entails a return to normal and high utilization. Continued high element of packaged  services also generates opportunities for reuse and higher profitability.

Our three largest markets, Sweden, Norway and Germany, all increased their margins and  reported growth. While we are proud of all that we have achieved in our assignments, we are pursuing our own internal  changes at increasing speed to achieve our long-term goals. Packaging our solutions and greater relevance in each  assignment is resulting in a higher price, a cost-efficient delivery model with the right mix of offshore and nearshore  and continued recruitment of the most gifted personnel. In August, we will start our thirteenth trainee program with  24 highly talented, new employees.  The most important element is that we continue to create confidence among our customers. In Sweden, we are  increasingly noting how a strong position in an area with a customer is expanding to both of the other parts of the  organization and in the form of projects with a different content. We are increasingly securing confidence from  customers to strengthen their ability to make strategic changes, both formulating and implementing such changes, and  also creating a digital strategy and maximizing the effect of investments in new technology in relation to existing  solution environments. Acando’s ability to combine the necessary disciplines for this digital journey creates brand new  opportunities for us and our customers.   Norway continued to perform well and during the quarter, we continued to expand in our priority areas, the public  sector and energy, and we also started to see the effects of the cooperation between Sweden and Norway for securing  a clearer position in the retail segment.   Germany also reported an increasing margin with closer relations with our largest customers and more new opportunities  driven by digitization, as well as also industrial efficiency enhancements.  I also noted that the innovation aspect of our assignments is increasing. This is a particular consequence of Acando  benefiting from working at earlier stages with a number of new, smaller companies that are completing changing the  way they look at digital solutions. In these assignments we set challenges and are challenged ourselves, and it not least  provides us and our customers with brand new perspectives about what can be achieved.  Finally, I noted that our position in Microsoft Dynamics was further consolidated when we received an invitation to the  Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle, to which only a few successful partners are invited. With this achievement, I credit our  fantastic consultants, our ability to mobilize the correct competencies and resources when required and not least our  customers who challenge us to always perform at our very best.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (26)  www.acando.com    Significant events    Second quarter, 2015  The Nordic region’s leading mail order company, the Ellos Group, chose Acando’s services and the Darwin framework  for developing tomorrow’s decision support. Darwin is both a method and a software that substantially reduces the  investment in development and the administration cost of data stores.     The assignment with Arvid Nilsson AB, a supplier of fasteners in the Nordic market, for replacing its complex existing  Business Intelligence systems with a more easily understandable solution based on Microsoft BI was completed during  the second quarter.    Based on a new framework agreement with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, Acando is delivering a new  public map service to make it easier for the public to plan routes and travel more efficiently and appropriately. The  new map-based system will replace many of the different information channels in place today.    Acando was entrusted by the Norwegian Tax Administration to deliver a project aimed at establishing information  structures (semantic data modelling) to efficiently handle high volumes of data (“big data”).    In Norway, the Association of Social Scientists signed an agreement during the quarter for implementing a new member  solution based on Microsoft CRM. This is another implementation of an Acando solution, Medlem 2020, targeted to  member organizations.    At the start of June, Acando Norway signed an agreement with Antares to acquire Antares Group’s operational business.  Acando in Norway will thus gain 20 additional senior consultants from September 1, 2015. The Antare Group primarily  comprises senior consultants with expertise in systems development, architecture, consulting services, integration and  project management. The company has provided both front-end and back-end consulting services, the largest area being  Java.    Acando in Germany worked on supporting the BGW (the German professional association for health services and welfare)  in introducing agile project management used in the relaunch of the www.bgw-online.de platform.    Acando came in 24th place of the most attractive employers this year among Nordic IT students according to the  Universum survey of most attractive employer in the Nordic region presented in May. A total of 38,500 economics,  technology and IT students from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland voted on the most attractive employer in the  Nordic region.

We stand out due to our ability to combine  skills in strategy and business operations with sound technical expertise and deep understanding of how organizations  function. The Group has approximately 1,800 employees allocated over four countries in Europe and delivery centers in  India and Latvia.        Acando’s offering    Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through a combination  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established methods and tools are in place to  be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.    The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting companies  as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing.     Acando is the only Swedish company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and  IT to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below. Application Services primarily includes longer commitments  for administration and support services.                 INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (26)  www.acando.com  Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments. Acando  traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The company’s position in the retail segment has become increasingly strong with digital customer  interaction being the driving area of expertise. In the finance segment as well, particularly banking and insurance,  several new customers were added and rising demand was noted.    Banking, finance and insurance is a segment in which Acando noted continued expansion driven by moderation initiatives  for technology platforms and requirements for greater digital maturity in both transaction environments and customer  interaction. The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it  well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities and agencies. The investment area includes e-health in the health  care segment and solutions for improved business support for municipalities.              Market development in the second quarter  Demand in Sweden remains healthy and on a par with the start of 2015, albeit with certain geographical differences  where Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region are performing best. In Germany, the demand situation remains normal,  which was also the case for Norway. The weakest market is Finland, where it remains cautious and assignments are both  fewer and subject to intense competition. For 2015, demand is expected to continue in line with how it started.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, implementation and technology.        INTERIM REPORT   January 1 – June 30, 2015     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (26)  www.acando.com  Net sales and earnings    Second quarter April - June 2015  Net sales and operating profit before goodwill impairment (EBITA) for the second quarter of 2015 are shown in the table  below:    Consolidated net sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 566 m (388). EBITA was SEK 38 m (6), corresponding to a margin  of 6.7 percent (1.6).     The year-on-year strengthening in earnings for Sweden was attributable to a slightly raised utilization rate. The  utilization rate in Norway also improved; the comparative period in 2014 included a restructuring cost of SEK 4.4 m that  was charged to earnings for 2014. The item Other countries includes Acando’s operations in Finland and the delivery  centers in India and Latvia. The utilization rate was weak in the quarter in all of these units. Finland was significantly  impacted by a very weak domestic market and India and Riga were affected by several major project closeouts that had  previously entailed high utilization.    Consolidated profit after tax totaled SEK 27 m (5). Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.27 (0.07).

Harvested  volumes were record high at 14.2 thousand tonnes gutted weight in Q2 2015. The combined farming  and VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 279.9 million in Q2 2015. The Farming segment  made an operational EBIT of DKK 248.4 million. The global salmon spot prices continued to decrease  in Q2 2015. The decrease in spot prices had a positive effect on Bakkafrost’s VAP segment, which had  stable market conditions and made an operational EBIT of DKK 31.5 million in Q2 2015. The EBITDA  for the FOF segment was DKK 53.0 million in Q2 2015.    The Group made a profit for the quarter of DKK  191.1 million (DKK 126.2 million). For H1 2015, the  profit was DKK 323.5 million (DKK 213.4 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q2 2015 were  14,182 tonnes gutted weight (11,212 tgw), which is  record high harvest in a quarter for Bakkafrost.  Total harvested volumes in H1 2015 were 23,908  tonnes gutted weight (20,481 tgw). The guidance  for volumes for 2015 is unchanged.    Bakkafrost transferred 1.4 million smolts in Q2  2015 (1.9 million), which is in line with the com- pany’s plans. Transferred smolts in H1 2015 were  3.6 million smolts (4.9 million).    In accordance with the Group’s dividend policy and  the resolution of the Annual General Meeting 2015,  Bakkafrost paid out DKK 6.00 (NOK 6.78) per  share in April 2015 as dividend for 2014. This cor- responds to DKK 293.1 million (NOK 331.1 mil- lion).    The combined farming and VAP segments made  an operational EBIT of DKK 279.9 million (DKK  180.0 million) in Q2 2015. For H1 2015, the com- bined farming and VAP segment made an opera- tional EBIT of DKK 496.7 million (DKK 356.7 mil- lion).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 248.4 million (DKK 159.5 million) in Q2 2015.  The harvested volumes are higher, while the aver- age spot price is lower in Q2 2015, compared with  Q2 2014. For H1 2015, the operational EBIT was  DKK 443.4 million (DKK 345.7 million).  The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 31.5 million (DKK 20.5 million) for Q2 2015.  There is normally a time lag between the changes  in the spot prices and the changes in the contract  prices. The contract prices have increased signifi- cantly from the level in Q2 2014. Therefore, the  VAP result for Q2 2015 has improved, compared to  last year. For H1 2015, the operational EBIT was  DKK 53.4 (DKK 11.0 million).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 53.0 million (DKK 57.0  million) in Q2 2015. The record high EBITDA mar- gin of 30.5% in Q1 2015 decreased to 18.7% in Q2  2015, as expected. The high margin in Q1 2015  was primarily due to low purchase prices during  the autumn last year, and this effect diminished in  Q2 2015. The operational EBITDA was 115.6 mil- lion in H1 2015 (DKK 79.1 million), corresponding  to an EBITDA margin of 23.7% for H1 2015.  In Q2 2015, Havsbrún sourced 86,012 tonnes of  raw material (107,372 tonnes) and in H1 2015,  Havsbrún sourced 161,015 tonnes of raw material  (151,531 tonnes).  The Bakkafrost Group’s net interest bearing debt  amounted to DKK 301.9 million at the end of Q2  2015 (DKK 232.7 million at year-end 2014) includ- ing deposits and losses on financial derivatives  relating to the interest bearing debt. Bakkafrost  had undrawn credit facilities of approximately DKK  720.7 million, of which DKK 17.8 million were re- stricted at the end of Q2 2015.  Bakkafrost’s equity ratio at 30 June 2015 is 61%,  compared with 60% at the end of 2014.             Condensed Consolidated Interim Report for Q2 2015 and H1 2015  Issued August 25th 2015        4  Farming and VAP performance per kg    Q2   Q2   YTD   YTD  Operational EBIT/kg 2015   2014   2015   2014  Farming EBIT/kg (DKK) 17.52 14.23   18.55   16.88  Farming EBIT/kg (NOK) 20.07   15.65   21.49   18.75  VAP EBIT/kg (DKK) 6.22 3.44   5.56   0.93  VAP EBIT/kg (NOK) 7.13   3.79   6.45   1.04    Smolt transfer    Bakkafrost Group                        1,000 pieces     2011   2012   2013   2014   2015E  Farming North     5,000   6,500   7,200   3,000   6,600  Farming West     2,600   4,200   2,300   7,400   3,800  Viking     1,000   0   0   0   0   Total     8,600   10,700   9,500   10,400   10,400

A gradual increase in utilization rates, combined with efficiency measures and  more working days in the quarter, led to significant margin improvements. We noted the same effect with rising margins  in all countries over the first six months. Our sales growth also continued in Germany and Norway.    During the quarter, we launched Itch, a digital innovation agency comprising some of the leading digital profiles in  Sweden, to unleash the power of true digital innovation combined with Acando’s total expertise in strategic change.  We believe that our history, culture and ability to create lasting value make us unique, and our ambition to take a  leading position in a world of opportunities remains firm. To succeed with this mission, we must continue to adapt our  offering and develop our expertise in line with the needs around us.    We can now see the effects of our changes over the past two years in the form of a clearer digital offering, a strong and  comprehensive capability around business system implementation and management consultancy operations that form  an integral part of our total offering. We have adjusted the structure of our delivery centers and chosen to focus on the  Baltics, and created a clear operational focus to drive our customer interaction and delivery processes.    The proportion of project-based deliveries is growing and customers are increasingly seeing Acando as an alternative,  due to our high level of efficiency and ability to drive full-service assignments. Several customers have commented on  how our consultants are taking personal responsibility far beyond the limits of their own assignments and we are proud  of the culture we are creating together, and recreating in our assignments. Our Banking and Finance focus is growing,  driven by our ability to lead large-scale transformations. A major trading Group has engaged us to build a new e- commerce solution based on efficient delivery, and we are creating a collaboration solution for one of Sweden’s largest  industrial companies based on our ability to understand unique conditions. We have created a structure that enables  growth and continued operating efficiency enhancement, and although we are proud of the improvements we see, we  are not satisfied. We can, and want, to do more!    Attracting talent is a prerequisite for success and Acando needs to continue recruiting in all areas. Acando’s strategy is  to create tomorrow’s leading consultants through a well-developed trainee program. We are proud that Universum has  nominated Acando as “Employer Branding Company of the Year.”   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 - June 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 2 (26)  www.acando.com  Significant events during and after the quarter    Acando’s digital innovation agency, Itch, was launched on June 3. The company aims to secure a leading position in the  Northern European market within three years. Demand for digital innovation has never been so high, and Itch provides  support in the innovation and development of business models, products, services and marketing. Based on user  experience and new technology, Itch provides services ranging from consultancy and service design, to visualization and  prototyping.    In Sweden, Acando has secured a major framework agreement with Kammarkollegiet, the Swedish Legal, Financial and  Administrative Services Agency for the study, management and control of development needs in central government  agencies. The services included in the agreement are advanced studies, analyses, reviews or evaluations as a basis for  decisions. Strategic advice for management teams in governance-related issues is also included. The framework  agreement covers all authorities and has a maximum duration of four years.    Acando and ITMC SOFT have entered into a partnership to conduct sales of, and implement, IDM365, the identity and  access management solution available through ITMC SOFT. The IDM365 solution is consistent with Acando’s strategy,  which is based on guiding customers through the entire identity and access management life cycle. ITMC SOFT’s  expertise, combined with Acando’s local presence, experience and knowledge, provide an opportunity to create a real  market-leading experience and added value for customers.    Acando partners with GeekGirlMeetUp and in June, participated in the Better TogetHer event, as part of the process to  realize Acando’s vision: A More Capable World. GeekGirls is a network for women and girls in the IT and technology  industry, which welcomes and actively promotes gender equality in the industry. This is a mission that Acando  wholeheartedly supports and that harmonizes with Acando’s vision.

The goal is to streamline the services that  make documents available to the public.      INTERIM REPORT   January 1 - June 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 3 (26)  www.acando.com  Business activities      Introduction  Acando is a consulting company whose business concept, in partnership with its customers, is to create business value  by enhancing and streamlining processes, organizations and digital solutions.

Disruptive business models,  enhanced customer experiences and structured use of new technology are strong drivers in several sectors, and demand  for process and operational efficiency, control and information utilization is also increasing.    Within Enterprise projects are driven based on SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX business systems. The business systems  are key to driving efficiency enhancements and enabling new services. Acando holds an extremely strong position in AX  and SAP, with the highest partner status and is one of only a few global members of the Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle.  Continued efficiency enhancements typify the market for business systems, at the same time as SAP’s and Microsoft’s  move toward cloud-based delivery models and new technology platforms creates new possibilities in an area where  Acando has a favorable position in terms of an established customer base and skills.     Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are driven by a  combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on modern technology  and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in several of the most rapidly  growing areas.    Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time, Acando  aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered projects.   INTERIM REPORT   January 1 - June 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 4 (26)  www.acando.com  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.            Customers and segments  Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long-term,  stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business-development  assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both Sweden and Germany, and  with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also drive the need for a more flexible and agile  supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major full-service assignments with  several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted driven by  a need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers. In combination with  regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs at many companies in the  sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments linked to leading transformation and the development of digital  services, particularly in Sweden and Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external factors.  In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly integrated services  aimed at customers are driving the need for more advanced digital platforms. Given historically low oil prices, a  declining propensity for investment has been noted in the oil and gas segment. Acando has extensive experience and a  strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy companies and a number of smaller local companies.    35% 40% 15% 10% Shares of sales by offering Management Digital Enterprise Application Services  INTERIM REPORT   January 1 - June 30, 2016     ACANDO AB (publ.) 5 (26)  www.acando.com  The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well-suited  to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for efficiency,  increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong position in Norway comprises the base for  continued expansion in terms of content and geographical coverage.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitization. Investments are focused on efficient  information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital interaction.  Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the segment in both Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using standard  platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value. The media and  entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact with consumers and professional  operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.              Market trend in the second quarter  Demand in Sweden remained healthy and on a par with 2015, albeit with certain geographical differences where  Stockholm and the Mälar Valley region comprise clear growth areas. In Germany, demand remained normal during the  first six months. The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with an  increasingly noticeable decline in the willingness to invest in oil-related sectors, thus resulting in increasing competition  for available assignments. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious. The assessment is that  the conditions and the trends noted at the end of 2015 will continue into 2016, however, uncertainty in the macro  environment could impact the level of demand.    Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation and completely new application areas for technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become  crucial to create clear links between strategy, innovation, implementation and technology.     19% 6% 12% 27% 18% 12% 6% Share of sales by customer segment Retial Energy Telecom, IT, media and entertainment Industry Public authorities and agencies Banking, finance and insurance Healthcare

Harvested volumes were 13.0 thousand tonnes gutted weight. The combined farming and  VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 289.5 million. The farming segment made  an operational EBIT of DKK 357.9 million and the increased salmon spot prices had a positive  effect on the farming segment. The high salmon spot prices affected the VAP segment  negatively, and the VAP Segment made an operational EBIT of DKK -68.4 million. The  EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 45.4 million.      The Group made a profit for the second quarter 2016  of DKK 223.8 million (DKK 191.1 million). For H1  2016, the profit was DKK 437.1 million (DKK 323.5  million).    The total volumes harvested in Q2 2016 were 13,004  tonnes gutted weight (14,182 tgw). Total harvested  volumes in H1 2016 were 23,938 tonnes gutted  weight (23,908 tgw). The guidance for volumes for  2016 is unchanged.    Bakkafrost transferred 1.9 million smolts in Q2 2016  (1.4 million), which is in line with the company’s plans.  Transferred smolts in H1 2016 were 3.9 million smolts  (3.6 million).    In accordance with Bakkafrost’s dividend policy and  the resolution of the Annual General Meeting 2016,  Bakkafrost paid out DKK 8.25 (NOK 10.37) per share  in April 2016. The total dividend payment was DKK  403.1 million (NOK 506.6 million).    On 14 July 2016 Bakkafrost announced suspicion of  pathogenic ISA virus in farming site A-73  Hvannasund Norður on the basis of regularly ISA  tests results, carried out by the Veterinary Authorities  according to the Faroese veterinary system.  Consequently, Bakkafrost prepared to take  necessary actions and the Veterinary Authority  undertook further tests in order to confirm the  suspicion of pathogenic ISA virus. After a week of  extensive testing, all the results were negative and  did not prove the presence of pathogenic ISA virus.     After that, the Veterinary Authority increased  surveillance at the farming site A-73 Hvannasund  Norður and carried out extra tests on neighbouring  farming sites, which will be carried out for the next half  year. This procedure is stipulated in the Faroese  veterinary farming regime with the purpose of  securing and maintaining good biology in the Faroese  farming industry.    Bakkafrost acquired the remaining outstanding  shares (51%) of P/F Faroe Farming, effective from 1  July 2016. The Faroese Registry and the Competition  Authorities have approved Bakkafrost’s acquisition of  P/F Faroe Farming. Simultaneously, Bakkafrost filed  (relinquished) two farming licenses to the Faroese  Authorities. Following these two transactions, Bakka- frost has 14 licenses for farming salmon in the Faroe  Islands.    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 289.5 million (DKK 279.9  million) in Q2 2016. For H1 2016, the combined  farming and VAP segment made an operational EBIT  of DKK 525.4 million (DKK 496.7 million).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 357.9 million (DKK 248.4 million) in Q2 2016.  The harvested volumes are lower, while the average  spot price is higher in Q2 2016, compared with Q2  2015. For H1 2016, the operational EBIT was DKK  618.6 million (DKK 443.4 million).    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  -68.4 million (DKK 31.5 million) for Q2 2016. The high  spot prices in Q2 2016 had a negative effect on the  operational EBIT in the VAP segment. There is  normally a time lag between the changes in the spot  prices and the changes in the contract prices. The  spot prices have increased significantly in 2016 from  the level in 2015. Therefore, the VAP result for Q2  2016 has decreased, compared to last year. For H1  2016, the operational EBIT was DKK -93.2 (DKK 53.4  million).  INTERIM REPORT FOR Q2 2016 and H1 2016                  BAKKAFROST    |  4  |    ISSUED AUGUST 23rd 2016     The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  operational EBITDA of DKK 45.4 million (DKK 53.0  million) in Q2 2016 and the EBITDA margin was  20.7% (18.7%).

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2017  Price-sensitive information that   has to be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (24)  Interim report    Second quarter April 1 – June 30, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 613 m (578)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 55 m (62)   > The operating margin was 9.0% (10.7)  > Profit after tax was SEK 41 m (62)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.40 (0.60)    Accumulated January 1 – June 30, 2017  > Net sales totaled SEK 1,234 m (1,104)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 130 m (96)   > The operating margin was 10.5% (8.7)  > Profit after tax was SEK 95 m (86)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.93 (0.83)  > Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 56 m (64)   Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  A continued healthy financial trend with strong growth and rising profits was posted for the first half of the  year. Altogether, we grew our sales by 12 percent to SEK 1,234 m and increased profits 35 percent to SEK  130 m. At 10.5 percent, our operating margin is the highest ever for the first six months of the year. In the  year’s second quarter, we grew our sales to SEK 613 m, our highest second quarter sales to date, despite  the negative effect of fewer working days compared with last year.  The positive financial trend is a result of our capacity to develop and thereby remain relevant for customers,  partners and employees.  Acando’s innovation survey was launched during the quarter, and clearly shows that many larger  companies are focusing their innovation capacity on increasing their customer relevance in a world that is  rapidly and continuously changing, not least due to all the possibilities opened by digitalization. Acando’s  strategy of combining technology, as the driver, together with behavioral insights is thus becoming  increasingly relevant. The acquisitions of Transformator Design and Daytona strengthen our capabilities in  terms of understanding the customer perspective and securing capacity to design a full omnichannel  customer experience, digital and analog. Altogether, this gives us a unique position from which we can not  only support definitions of strategies with a strong customer focus, but are also able to realize these through  transformative projects ranging from the creation of in-house digital capabilities to the realization of  technical solutions. Our compiled expertise makes us unique in the Nordic market.  Acando’s strategy of providing customers with a unique possibility for capitalizing on our partner  relationships is based on a portfolio of strong, relevant partners and long-standing partner relationships.  During the quarter, we expanded our partner portfolio to strengthen our capabilities in the retail/fashion  segment and in the cloud-based business systems solution area, both of which are experiencing vigorous  growth. More importantly, we were presented with the Partner of the Year award for Sweden by Microsoft  for our ability to create innovative and transformative solutions based on Microsoft’s products and services.  Moreover, Acando has once again been chosen as an Inner Circle Partner for Microsoft Dynamics, an  exclusive global selection of Microsoft’s most strategic partners.   Our success relies entirely on our employees’ ambition and capacity to create relations of trust with our  customers and their employees. These relationships engender the security to challenge one another and,  through shared experiences, abilities and skills, to identify innovative solutions and approaches. We are  growing and take pride in the increasing numbers that wish to join us and to continue this quest of creating  the most challenging and developing environment for those that have the desire and the courage to match.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (24)  Significant events during and after the quarter    Acando in Norway won a framework agreement for consulting services with the Brønnøysund Register  Centre (Norwegian company registrations office).

The aim is to replace outdated system solutions in time to ensure the continued  ability of the Brønnøysund Register Centre to provide good registry services, adapted to new requirements  and expectations as a result of the transition to digital administration. The contract is for three years with  an option to extend for a maximum of four further years.    After the end of the period, Acando signed agreements to acquire the two companies Transformator Design  and Daytona on September 1. The companies will together with Acando create offerings within strategy,  design, tech, innovation, change management and communication. Acando gains 60 more employees, who  will contribute by creating strategies and designing solutions based on customers’ needs for all channels.  The new operations will be consolidated into the Acando Group from September 1, 2017.    Acando has won the Microsoft Partner of the Year Award 2017 for Sweden. The Microsoft Partner of the  Year awards are presented to those Microsoft partners who have developed and delivered exceptional  Microsoft-based solutions over the last year. Acando was recognized for providing first-class solutions and  services, and for representing a strong corporate partner in Sweden. The awards are presented for a  number of categories, with the winners chosen from a base of more than 2,800 participants representing  115 countries around the world.    Acando was chosen to join Microsoft’s Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle. The Inner Circle comprises an  exclusive, strategic selection of Microsoft partners, which have won acclaim through strong customer  relationships and successful projects. This provides Acando with the possibility of providing its customers  with even better support in close collaboration with Microsoft.          Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and  human behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change. Our  customers come from every sector and include a mix of major global organizations as well as medium- sized regional companies. We operate in a Northern European market with offices in Sweden, Finland,  Norway, Germany and Latvia, and have a total of 1,700 employees.        INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (24)  Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results and value for the customer. This value is achieved through  a combination of all of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationship with the customer. Well-established  methods and tools are in place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the  project.  The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting  companies as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish  company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital  solutions to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project  implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:  Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are  driven by a combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based  on modern technology and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well- positioned in several of the most rapidly growing areas in terms of user-centric solutions and digital product  innovation as well as industrial transformation through digitalization. We are entering a new era, when work  processes are partially replaced or expanded with digital solutions, which means that IT is no longer just  business support, but also functions as an expansion or integrated part of our customers’ processes,  products, services and entire business. Acando’s digital innovation agency, Itch, is a key element in  developing Acando’s offering within digital services and product innovation.  Consulting is active in all major industries and offers in-depth expertise in Strategy, Operational Control,  Sales & Marketing, Supply Chain and Operations. Acando’s broad knowledge base and cross-functional  business teams ensure a holistic perspective and good understanding of the customers, which means that  we can offer innovative perspectives and solutions that generate unexpected added value. Acando’s  absolute strength is the transformation process and its high speed of implementation.   Enterprise is the leading Swedish supplier of platform-related services on selected platforms: SAP,  Dynamics AX and Netsuite. Together with our customers, we ensure that maximum value is created from  platform investments. We combine extensive operational expertise and well-tried methodology with  functional and technical platform competence.   Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over  time, Acando aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and  delivered projects.      Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.       INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (24)  Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for  long-term, stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different  segments.    Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business- development assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both  Sweden and Germany, and with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway. A high level of  innovation and efficiency enhancement in traditional industrial companies is enabled by digital capabilities  in product content, such as business models and processes. Acando is well-positioned to create completely  new possibilities in the segment, together with its customers, through a combination of transformative  implementations and deep technical expertise.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction  and e-commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also create the need for a  more flexible and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has  major full-service assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany  and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been  noted as a result of the need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with  customers. In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured  transformation programs at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments  linked to leading the transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and  Germany.    The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and  external factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more  highly integrated services aimed at customers are increasing the need for more advanced digital platforms.  Acando has extensive experience and a strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy  companies as well as a number of smaller local companies.    The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make  it well-suited to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by  demands for efficiency, increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong  position in Norway comprises the base for continued expansion in terms of content and geographical  coverage.    The health care segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused  on efficient information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of  digital interaction. Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the  segment in both Sweden and Norway.      INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2017        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  5 (24)  The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using  standard platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater  value. The media and entertainment segment is driven by expansive digital services and the need to interact  with consumers and professional operators. Acando’s main position is linked to the operator segment.    See below for the share of sales by customer segment.            Second quarter market trend    Demand remained healthy in Sweden through H1 2017. All regions in Sweden trended positively, primarily  driven by the increasing need for digitalization. In Germany, demand remained normal during the period.  The market in Norway was characterized by continued public sector investments in parallel with a gentle  recovery in oil-related sectors. The weakest market is Finland, where the market remains cautious albeit  with a slight positive trend.   Long-term demand is expected to remain favorable across Acando’s markets, driven by accelerating digital  transformation, digital content in products and services, and completely new application areas for  technology in business processes. Accordingly, it will become crucial to create clear links between strategy,  innovation, implementation, user behavior and technology.

The farming segment made  an operational EBIT of DKK 489.5 million. The salmon spot prices have been on record high  levels since 2016 and this continued in Q2 2017. The high salmon spot price is positive for  the farming segment. As in previous quarters, when the salmon spot prices are high, the VAP  segment had negative margins in Q2 2017. The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK -54.5 million. The EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 47.8 million.      The Group made a profit for the second quarter 2017  of DKK 398.1 million (DKK 223.8 million). For H1  2017, the profit was DKK 477.1 million (DKK 437.1  million).

The guidance for volumes for  2017 is unchanged.    Bakkafrost transferred 1.9 million smolts (1.9 million)  during Q2 2017, which is in line with the company’s  plans. Transferred smolts in H1 2017 were 3.3 million  smolts (3.9 million).    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 435.0 million (DKK 289.5  million) in Q2 2017. The operational EBIT per kg in  Q2 2017 was DKK 23.64 (DKK 22.26), which corre- sponds to NOK 29.77 (NOK 27.88) for the combined  farming and VAP segments.

The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK  -54.5 million (DKK -68.4 million) for Q2 2017. Al- though the sales prices in the VAP segment have  increased, the VAP segment continued to have neg- ative results, primarily due to the high salmon spot  prices. For H1 2017, the operational EBIT was DKK   -107.5 million (DKK -93.2 million).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  EBITDA of DKK 47.8 million (DKK 45.4 million) for Q2  2017, and the EBITDA margin was 15.1% (20.7%).

  INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2018  Price-sensitive information that  must be reported to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority      1 (24)  Interim report    Second quarter April 1–June 30, 2018  > Net sales totaled SEK 736 m (613)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 74 m (55)     > Operating margin 10.1% (9.0)  > Profit after tax was SEK 56 m (41)  > Earnings per share were SEK 0.54 (0.40)    Accumulated January 1–June 30, 2018  > Net sales totaled SEK 1,439 m (1,234)  > Operating profit amounted to SEK 151 m (130)   > Profit before non-recurring items SEK 155 m   > Operating margin 10.5% (10.5)  > Profit after tax was SEK 115 m (95)  > Earnings per share were SEK 1.11 (0.93)  > Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 27 m (56)     Statement by Carl-Magnus Månsson, CEO  The second quarter of 2018 remained positive; we grew by 20 percent compared with the year-earlier period,  and growth for the first half of the year was 17 percent. Operating profit increased 35 percent in the quarter, and  operating profit for the first half of the year totaled SEK 155 m, the highest result for a first half-year in Acando’s  history. While all geographies contributed both growth and increased profit, we have the potential to capitalize  further on the strong market in which we operate, above all by remaining an attractive company for highly  talented employees. Our trainee program continues to attract talents; during the summer the largest batch of  trainees ever began their careers at Acando. We are proud that they chose us.   The world around us is being driven more and more quickly by the opportunities technology provides. At the  same time, understanding human behavior and applying that knowledge in our everyday operations is key to  creating the best solutions. Regulatory requirements and the importance of creating public benefit with staying  power are becoming increasingly important components in many of our assignments. Acando’s strategy of being  “Technology Driven and Behavior Centric” remains highly relevant, and we continue to deepen and broaden our  offering in order to retain that relevance in a rapidly changing world.   A completely new solution, built on cloud-based components with both in-store and internet-based traffic, was  launched for one of Acando’s largest customers in the retail segment during the quarter — a project implemented  in record time. This is one of many examples of how the combination of system integration ability, an agile  working method and insights into industry-specific challenges can shorten lead times and create scalable  solutions.  Rapidity in terms of implementing and managing insights from available data is becoming more and more  important to our customers. Through the acquisition of September BI in Norway, we have gained access to an  established informational and analytical platform specifically adapted to the retail industry and the opportunity  to pursue growth in that segment both in Norway and in other geographies. Acando’s focus cloud-based  business systems is also being reinforced through the acquisition of Alterview, who in partnership with Acando’s  own operations is creating the leading partner for implementing Netsuite solutions in northern Europe.  The health sector is one of Acando’s most rapidly growing segments, and we are proud to have contributed to  the digitalization and automation of the processes for patient journeys in Norway. In addition to creating cost  efficiency and more rapid handling, the project has also resulted in more equal treatment. This is one of many  examples of how technology not only provides efficiency and new opportunities, but also creates greater value.    INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  2 (24)  Significant events during and after the quarter  Through its subsidiary Brickmakers, Acando Germany has digitized the first step in the manufacture of brake  linings at TMD Friction. This was done with the help of interactive 3D projections based on augmented reality.  Using Microsoft’s HoloLens AR glasses, Acando and Brickmakers have developed a virtual weighing app were  navigation occurs through modern controls using voice, eyes and gestures.  In Norway, in partnership with the Norwegian directorate for e-health, Acando led the “Mina patientresor” (My  Patient Journeys) project that makes it possible for users to apply for reimbursement of patient journeys online  at helsenorge.no. The project has helped to digitize and automate the application process, which in turn has led  to more rapid handling, more equal treatment and a higher level of cost efficiency.    During the quarter, Acando won a framework agreement for management consulting services with a  multinational supplier of information and communication technologies (ICT), thereby entering the company’s  Preferred Supplier List. Acando is one of ten consulting companies on the list globally.    Posten Norge AS signed a framework agreement with Acando for the delivery of consulting services in strategy  and business development. In the procurement process, Acando displayed its strength in the fields of innovation  strategy, logistics and value chain development, cost efficiency and improvement as well as digital strategy. The  framework agreement will cover the future needs of the entire Group.    Acando helped a leading airline enhance its efficiency and automate its sales of advertising space and the  production of marketing materials. By using the Brand Relations for Dynamics 365 solution, the entire process  was integrated into one solution, making it simpler for customers and employees.  Anywhere.24, part of the Acando Group, helped trade fair organizer DLG Service optimize its trade fair planning.  With its Event Relations industry solution, designed by Anywhere.24 and built on Microsoft Dynamics 365, DLG  Service’s project management and trade fair planning has been optimized through a 360-degree view of  exhibitors and customers.  During Microsoft’s “Microsoft Inspire” global partner conference, its partner organization IAMCP awarded prizes  as part of its IAMCP Awards Program competition. The prizes went to companies that had implemented creative  solutions and demonstrated successful collaboration with other partners. This year, Acando was one of the  finalists, presenting an implementation of a business system for a customer in the fashion industry. The focus  was on creating a clear transformation solution, making use of the collaborating partner’s competence and  striving to achieve a working process that built relationships. In particular, the goal was to improve the experience  for the company’s own customers.    On April 25, the Board of Directors of Acando AB, on the back of an authorization from the 2017 AGM, resolved  to carry out a new share issue, immediately thereafter buying back 900,000 Series C shares. This was carried  out through a private placement for cash of 900,000 Series C shares to the Swedish branch of Danske Bank  A/S, Denmark and an immediate buy-back in the second quarter. The subscription price for the shares  corresponded to their quotient value. The aim of the issue and buy-back of Series C shares is, following  conversion to Series B shares, to secure the provision of Series B shares to Group employees participating in  the 2017 share-savings program adopted at the AGM on May 4, 2017. The allocation of shares under the 2017  share-savings program will take place in August 2020.  During the second quarter, September BI was acquired in the Norway segment. September BI specializes in  retail business intelligence and has a great deal of knowledge in business intelligence and chain management.   All of the shares in Alterview Net Solution AB were acquired after the end of the period. This acquisition  reinforces Acando’s focus on cloud-based business systems and in partnership with Acando’s own operations,  is creating the leading partner for implementing Netsuite solutions in northern Europe. The new operations will  be consolidated into the Acando Group from September 1, 2018.      INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  3 (24)  Business activities    Introduction  Acando is a consulting company that leverages an equal balance of specialist technical expertise and human  behavioral insight to innovate, streamline and mobilize organizations for sustainable change. Our customers  come from every sector and include a mix of major global organizations as well as medium-sized regional  companies. We operate in a Northern European market with offices in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany and  Latvia, and have a total of 2,000 employees.    Acando’s offering  Acando’s offering is focused on actual results, and value for the customer achieved through a combination of all  of Acando’s skills and our long-term relationships with customers. Well-established methods and tools are in  place to be able to deliver Acando’s high level of quality in each phase of the project.  The Nordic market is mainly built on numerous small to medium-sized local IT and management consulting  companies as well as a few major global suppliers with a focus on outsourcing. Acando is the only Swedish  company with a sufficiently broad skills base and size in business systems, management and digital solutions  to be able to successfully compete with the major international companies in complex project implementations.     Acando’s core offering is divided into four main categories:  Digital guides customers and realizes solutions linked to digital innovation and transformation. Projects are  driven by a combination of digital business understanding and deep technical know-how in solutions based on  modern technology and platforms. The area has substantial growth potential and Acando is well-positioned in  several of the most rapidly growing areas in terms of user-centric solutions and digital product innovation as well  as industrial transformation through digitalization. We are entering a new era, when work processes are partially  replaced or expanded with digital solutions, which means that IT is no longer just business support, but also  functions as an expansion or integrated part of our customers’ processes, products, services and entire  business. Acando’s Business Design Studio is part of the operations, whereby customer-centric strategies and  digital innovation are core elements for creating the best customer experiences.  Consulting is active in all major industries and offers in-depth expertise in Strategy, Operational Control, Sales  & Marketing, Supply Chain and Operations. Acando’s broad knowledge base and cross-functional business  teams ensure a holistic perspective and good understanding of the customers, which means that we can offer  innovative perspectives and solutions that generate unexpected added value. Acando’s absolute strength is the  transformation process and its high speed of implementation.   Enterprise is the leading Swedish supplier of platform-related services on selected platforms: SAP, Dynamics  AX and Netsuite. Together with our customers, we ensure that maximum value is created from platform  investments. We combine extensive operational expertise and well-tried methodology with functional and  technical platform competence.   Application Services primarily includes longer commitments for administration and support services. Over time,  Acando aims to grow the share of assignments primarily linked to the existing customer base and delivered  projects.            INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  4 (24)  Each business area’s share of Group sales is shown below.             Customers and segments    Acando’s position with a healthy spread over different customer segments creates the preconditions for long- term, stable growth and provides the possibility of better balancing demand patterns between different  segments.      Acando traditionally has a strong position in the manufacturing industry with both efficiency and business- development assignments. The segment also includes a strong position in the automotive industry in both  Sweden and Germany, and with intelligent transport system assignments in Norway. A high level of innovation  and efficiency enhancement in traditional industrial companies is enabled by digital capabilities in product  content, business models and processes. Acando is well-positioned to create completely new possibilities in the  segment, together with its customers, through a combination of transformative implementations and deep  technical expertise.    The company’s position in the retail segment is strong with an offering where digital customer interaction and e- commerce drive development. Changed customer interaction patterns also create the need for a more flexible  and agile supply chain together with associated system and process changes. Acando has major full-service  assignments with several Swedish retail chains and a growing customer base in Germany and Norway.    In the financial segment, particularly banking and insurance, a continued increase in demand has been noted  as a result of the need for modernization in terms of technical platforms and digital relationships with customers.  In combination with regulatory requirements, this gives rise to the need for structured transformation programs  at many companies in the sector. In several cases, Acando runs assignments linked to leading the  transformation and development of digital services, particularly in Sweden and Germany.      INTERIM REPORT  January 1–June 30, 2018        Acando AB (publ.)  www.acando.com  5 (24)  The energy segment is typified by a need for streamlining and change driven by electricity prices and external  factors. In parallel, new distribution forms, advanced control and measurement systems, and more highly  integrated services aimed at customers are increasing the need for more advanced digital platforms. Acando  has extensive experience and a strong position with several of northern Europe’s largest energy companies as  well as a number of smaller local companies.  The public sector remains a key growth area and Acando’s service portfolio and geographic spread make it well- suited to meet the needs of public authorities, agencies and municipalities. Growth is driven by demands for  efficiency, increased transparency and digital interaction with citizens. Acando’s strong position in Norway  comprises the base for continued expansion in terms of content and geographical coverage.    The healthcare segment remains at an early stage of implementing digitalization. Investments are focused on  efficient information management, new methods with clear digital components and a greater degree of digital  interaction. Acando aims to capture a leading role and has a number of key assignments in the segment in both  Sweden and Norway.    The telecoms segment is characterized by clear efficiency enhancement and streamlining programs using  standard platforms and simplified operating models in parallel with defining new services that add greater value.

For details, see below.  ** CAPEX is defined as investments in intangible, tangible and financial assets as reported in the statement of cash flows.    CEO’s statement    The main highlights from the second quarter 2016 were a continued strong sales momentum in Norway,  strengthening of the balance sheet through a successful private placement, the start of the migration to  ice.net’s own mobile phone network, and sustained improved results in our Swedish operation.    As mentioned in the Q1 2016 report, ice.net’s gross subscriber sales in Norway (mobile phone and mobile  broadband) totalled more than 50,000 in April and May alone. We are very pleased that the sales rate has  been maintained at very favourable levels throughout the entire summer period and into August.     Growing at the rapid speed we have done in Norway does not come free. Hence, a private placement was  successfully completed in June with the objective of raising proceeds to fund higher customer acquisition in  Norway than previously anticipated and higher investments in sites and IT-systems in order to have more on- net traffic and enable disruptive offerings. AINMT AS completed the NOK 429 million private placement and  subsequently subscribed shares in AINMT Holdings AB, which in turn has granted a subordinated  shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS. The shareholder loan has a cap of NOK 450 million with  an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million. This gives our Norwegian operation added financial flexibility  going forward, and will enable it to continue on its current growth path.    In late June, only one year after we launched our consumer smartphone proposition in Norway, we started  the process of migrating our smartphone customers from Telia’s network across to ice.net’s own 4G-only  network. As expected, this has been a technical and operational challenge for our Norwegian operation, but  each task has been solved with highly satisfactory results. A continuing strong customer intake in both  existing and new sales channels throughout the summer, in addition to high volumes of customer being  migrated to our new platform, has led to longer waiting time than normal at customer care. Churn increased  somewhat in July, but still within industry average. The migration process as now been finalised for our  consumer customers which will improve the situation greatly.    In Sweden, Net1 continues to deliver improved performance. We expect the solid profitability level to  continue in the coming quarters.   AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Second Quarter 2016  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (10)  Significant events during the second quarter     Phil Hewinson, Facebook’s head of third-party mobile app monetization in Europe, Middle East and  Africa, joined the board of directors of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS’s parent company, AINMT  Holdings AB.   AINMT AS completed a private placement through issuance of new shares for a total consideration of  NOK 429 million which was used to subscribe for 6,601,556 new shares in AINMT Scandinavia  Holdings AS’s parent company AINMT Holdings AB. The latter will use the proceeds to fund higher  customer acquisition in Norway than previously anticipated and to fund higher investments in sites  and IT-systems in Norway in order to have more on-net traffic and enable disruptive offerings.   Start-up of the process to migrate all mobile phone customers in Norway from Telia’s network across  to ice.net’s own network.    Significant events after the end of the period     In August, following the share issue in AINMT AS and AINMT Holdings AB (see “significant events  during the second quarter” above), the latter granted a subordinated shareholder loan to AINMT  Scandinavia Holdings AS. The shareholder loan has a cap of NOK 450 million with an initial  disbursement of NOK 200 million and runs with 9.75% interest.  The loan is subordinated to AINMT  Scandinavia Holdings AS' high yield bond (ISIN: NO0010705601). This means, inter alia, that during  the term of this bond loan the shareholder loan is non-amortising and no interest is payable (PIK).    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 157 versus 129 for the equivalent period the  previous year.

The investments are mainly related to the network smartphone migration project in Norway, both on existing  and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK 2,724 (7,450) thousands.    EBITDA    Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the second quarter amounts to NOK 15,136  (5,247) thousands and the total year-to-date amounts to NOK 26,083 (13,087) thousands. Non-recurring  items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade.  For the 2015  numbers, the NOK 94.6 million net positive effect from the acquisition of Network Norway in the first quarter  is not included in the EBITDA.

In Q1 2014 the CAPEX includes the newly acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    The second quarter is generally characterised by higher demand for subscriptions as most people prepare  for summer holidays, which implies higher subscriber acquisition costs and reduced EBITDA for the  period. This year we chose to be less expansive with respect to new customer intake due to the planned  4G roll-out and our associated CDMA to 4G swap, which tempered the customer acquisition costs. In  addition we incur higher license fees due to the increased spectrum that we have secured. Nevertheless,  I'm pleased to add that the Swedish operation delivered its first ever EBITDA positive quarter.  This July – July has historically been our best performing month – we had record demand for additional  capacity from our customers with top-up revenues growing 125%+ y-o-y in both Norway and Sweden.  The demand for faster speeds and more capacity will continue to grow and this demand exists throughout  the countries we operate in and not just in the urban centres. The complementary aspects of the 450MHz  band will be essential in satisfying this demand throughout Scandinavia.  In Norway we have now moved to our new premises and our recruiting efforts continue. The vendor  selection process is very promising in terms of number of bidders and equipment availability and this  process is expected to be finalized in September. We are pleased with the progress to date in preparing  our 4G launch.  Our subsidiary Ice Norge AS was asked by the Norwegian Competition Authorities (NCA) to express its  views on the announced acquisition of Tele2 Norway by TeliaSonera.  Our response was submitted in August.     AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Second Quarter 2014  Corporate identity nr 913 192 354      Quarterly Report 2014  Page 2 (18)  Significant events during the second quarter    No specific event has occurred during the second quarter.    Summary of the first six months    During the first quarter 2014 the AINMT Group, through AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS, successfully  issued a High Yield Bond. The bond (ISIN NO 001 0705601) was placed in SEK with the amount of 1.5  billion at 9.75% interest rate with semi-annual interest payments. Settlement date was 19 March 2014;  maturity date is 19 March 2019. In connection to the bond issue, AINMT Holdings AB transferred its  Scandinavian subsidiaries to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS. Part of the proceeds from the bond has  initially been used to repay certain external loans. The company is left with a strong cash position to fund  growth.    The Group is in active discussions with a number of telecom equipment vendors that have positively  responded to our 4G build out plans. In Norway, the company secured new premises to cope with the  planned increase in headcount. The recruiting process is progressing well with a number of key hires  already made. The Swedish operation made its first ever EBITDA positive quarter.    For further details on the bond, please visit our website www.ainmt.com and investor relations.

Investments in intangible assets consist of frequency spectrum licences and capitalised costs for research  and development. Investments in tangible assets are primarily related to network capacity expansions,  both on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the second quarter amounts to kNOK 1,152 (13,709) and the total  year-to-date amounts to kNOK 5,705 (13,902).

In 2014 the Jan-Jun CAPEX includes the acquired licenses in Norway obtained via the contribution of Ice Communications Norge AS.      CEO’s statement    In June, only three months after acquiring the Network Norway customer base from TeliaSonera, AINMT’s  Norwegian operation launched its consumer smartphone proposition under the brand ice.net.  Simultaneously, Network Norway was rebranded to ice.net.  The initial phase of the agreement to acquire Tele2’s mobile network infrastructure, including the Oslo  underground system and Oslo Airport, came into effect on 1 April 2015.  Throughout the second quarter and the summer, a key focus in Norway, Sweden and Denmark was the  preparation for the mobile network upgrade. We started in Sweden and Denmark, with an upgrade of the  networks from 3G to 4G. In Norway, we have started to upgrade the 3G network to a multi-frequency 4G  network characterized by superior speed, capacity and coverage.  I am pleased to highlight that our Danish operation has already concluded the upgrade of its entire  network as of the end of August, becoming a 4G only internet access provider. The upgrades in Sweden  and Norway are planned to be finalised during October 2015.  In June, our Norwegian operation conducted two early pilot tests, installing the new 4G LTE network in  Årdal and Trysil. Årdal was chosen because of its challenging geography, with high mountains and deep  valleys. The feedback from ice.net’s customers have been extremely positive, both in terms of speed and  coverage.     AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Second Quarter 2015  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 2 (11)  Significant events during the second quarter     On 1 April 2015, Ice Communication Norge AS’ deal to acquire a substantial amount of Tele2’s  mobile network infrastructure, including the Oslo underground system and at Oslo Airport, came  into effect   ice.net went live as a consumer smartphone provider in Norway in June   Network Norway fully re-branded to ice.net   Successful pilot tests of the new 4G LTE network in Norway    Significant events after the end of the period     The entire Danish network upgraded from 3G to 4G by the end of August   Network upgrade started and progressing well in Norway and Sweden    Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 129 versus 82 for the equivalent period  the previous year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and  subcontractors, the Group employed 173 (98) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible assets during the second quarter amounted to NOK 45 (1,150)  thousands. The corresponding numbers for the first six months was kNOK 36,145 (716,739) thousands,  the major item being the acquisition of the business-to-business customer base from Network Norway in  February and for the comparison number the major item is the acquisition of Ice Communication Norge  AS that was awarded the spectrum licences in Norway in December 2013.    Investments in tangible assets during the second quarter amounted to NOK 54,934 (7,537) thousands and  the corresponding numbers for the first six months kNOK 134,186 (17,743). These investments are  mainly related to implementation of the new network and capacity expansions, both on existing and new  sites as well as on backbone systems.    As a consequence of the 4G investments the depreciations of the current networks are significantly higher  during 2015.    EBITDA    Non-recurring items identified during the second quarter amounts to NOK 5,247 (1,152) thousands and  the total year-to-date amounts to NOK 13,087 (5,705) thousands. Non-recurring items are mainly related  to inventory revaluations and restructuring measurements.    The NOK 94.6 million net positive effect from the acquisition of Network Norway in February 2015 is not  included in the EBITDA.       AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS  Second Quarter 2015  Corporate identity no 913 192 354  Quarterly report      Page 3 (11)  Risks and factors of uncertainty    AINMT Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings  or its financial position.

  DRAFT F                                                    ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS    SECOND QUARTER RESULTS    Q2 2017  SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2017                1  SECOND QUARTER 2017 SUMMARY    ⁎ Service revenue of NOK 298,896 thousand; 54% y-o-y growth  ⁎ EBITDA* of NOK -114,263 thousand  ⁎ Book equity of NOK 1,019,702 thousand      CEO’s statement    Ice group’s Scandinavian operation continues on its growth path. Service revenues grew 54% in the second quarter,  compared with the corresponding quarter last year. For the first half of 2017, service revenues increased 54.5%  compared to the first half of 2016. Our average smartphone on-net traffic continues to grow at a steady pace,  reaching 21% in the second quarter, compared to 13% in the first quarter. Increasing this figure represents an  opportunity to reduce network costs further. The company retains its target of 80% population coverage by Q4  2017/Q2 2018.    The mobile ARPU for ice.net decreased slightly in Q2 2017, related to NOK 7 million in deferred revenues as a  consequence of the introduction of data rollover from March 2017 onwards. As a result of ice.net’s customer centric  approach, we do not expect to see an uplift in ARPU until next year.      The EU roaming packages, with adjusted prices for the large majority of ice.net customers, were implemented  throughout the second quarter. As ice.net pre-warned customer a long time in advance, communicated the change  openly and honestly, and gave customers the opportunity to opt out of EU roaming included in the subscription, churn  was satisfactory throughout this period. However, sales of new subscriptions decreased from the previous period.  Sales have since risen after all operators included EU roaming in their subscriptions, enabling consumers to evaluate  different mobile phone subscriptions like-for-like again.   On 7 April, our new NOK 1.4 billion secured bank facilities underwritten by DNB Bank ASA and NOK 800 million  senior unsecured bond were signed and allocated, resulting in significantly reduced interest costs for the company. In  addition, the parent company injected NOK 200 million of equity into ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS on 28 June  2017, with the purpose of funding further growth ambitions in Norway, both in terms of customer acquisition and  network and IT infrastructure build-out.    The above-mentioned capital injection came into use when ice.net, subsequent to the quarter on 11 July 2017,  entered into an agreement to acquire a B2C customer base from Norwegian mobile phone operator Hello. Following  the forthcoming migration process, ice.net will expect to have acquired a net amount of 40,000 B2C customers.  Ice.net paid approximately NOK 75 million for the customer base, plus a potential bonus payment dependent on  number of subscribers successfully migrated to Ice. The migration process is expected to take place between August  and October 2017. The acquisition underlines ice.net’s position as the fastest growing mobile network operator in  Norway, and we look forward to reaping the full benefits from 2018 onwards.      2017 2016 2017 2016 Service revenue 298,896 194,257 578,948 374,844 EBITDA * -114,263 -76,232 -212,727 -87,324 CAPEX ** -176,747 -126,870 -413,342 -223,460 Total assets 3,160,411 2,606,549 3,160,411 2,606,549 Operating margin % nm nm nm nm Equity/assets ratio % 32% 20% 32% 20% NOK thousands ** CAPEX is defined as investments in non-current assets as reported in the statement of cash flows. * ice group defines EBITDA as operating profit after adjustment of operating expenses for depreciation, amortization and impairment  losses, foreign exchange differences recognized in income pertaining to revaluation of items in the balance sheet and non- recurring items.

The debt package also includes a five-year NOK 800 million unsecured bond paying N+525bps,  which closes simultaneously with the debt facility. The proceeds of the refinancing will be used to part- finance the full redemption of the existing SEK 1.5 billion bond and for general corporate purposes.  ⁎ On 21 April 2017, the company issued the call notice and redemption of the SEK 1.5 billion bond with ticker  AINMT01.

ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS  SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2018  Q2 2018  SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2018                1  SECOND QUARTER 2018 SUMMARY    ⁎ Service revenue of NOK 383,281 thousand; 30% y-o-y growth  ⁎ EBITDA 2) of NOK -76,337 thousand  ⁎ Book equity of NOK 838,980 thousand          CEO’s statement    For ice group’s Scandinavian operations, service revenues in the second quarter 2018 increased by 30% for the Group  and 38% for Norway compared with the corresponding quarter in 2017.    A key priority for the second quarter was to get in place important building blocks that allow us to continue developing  our Norwegian operation, further facilitating our own network build-out and strengthening the services we provide to  our customers. Additionally, the de-merger of ice group’s international business and the approved and improved group  ownership structure will result in a more focused strategy for our Scandinavian operations.    Entering into a new and improved NRA in Norway is one of the building blocks mentioned above. The new agreement  reflects the size of our current customer base and our own existing 4G network build-out, which reached 80% population  coverage in May. It also offers a higher level of flexibility and more favourable conditions for ice with regards to  effectuating further network build-out. Hence, we also signed a contract with Nokia that provides the framework to  facilitate a further network build-out in Norway at favourable terms for ice. In sum, these two agreements should  increase our customer proposition and competitiveness, improve operational visibility and position us well to deliver on  our growth ambitions while also containing our cost bases.     In the second quarter 2018, our average on-net data traffic increased to 55%, up from 41% in the first quarter. The on- net share continued to show an upward trend towards the end of the second quarter. Both smartphone ARPU and  blended ARPU (smartphone and mobile broadband) increased in Q2 2018 versus Q1 2018. Blended churn was  reduced in the same period. In May, we reached 500k customers (415k mobile voice and data customers plus 85k  mobile broadband customers), confirming our challenger position in Norway.    Since launching our smartphone offering in June 2015, we have been clear that we want to challenge the duopoly and  that our network is the key to further improve customer experience and our competitive position in the Norwegian  market. We have therefore been encouraged by recent comments from the Norwegian government and telecom  authorities where they stress the importance of three mobile networks. We remain dedicated to working towards our  common objective of providing Norwegian consumers with even better and more competitive products and services  through our own network.   2018 2017 2018 2017 Service revenue  1) 383,281 294,783 744,000 575,676 EBITDA  2) -76,337 -90,892 -202,278 -171,473 CAPEX  3) -193,694 -128,424 -379,962 -406,517 Total assets 3,704,190 3,400,178 3,704,190 3,400,178 Operating margin % nm nm nm nm Equity/assets ratio % 23% 37% 23% 37% NOK thousands Second Quarter 2) ice group defines EBITDA as operating profit after adjustment of operating expenses for depreciation, amortization and  impairment losses, foreign exchange differences recognized in income pertaining to revaluation of items in the balance sheet  and non-recurring items.

Jan - Jun SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2018                2  On 15 June 2018, the parent company structure of ice group Scandinavian Holdings AS announced that it had approved  a legal restructuring and a demerger, separating its international businesses in Indonesia and the Philippines from its  Scandinavian businesses, marking a new chapter in the development of ice group. Firstly, it enables a business strategy  with sole focus on Scandinavia. Secondly, it unlocks a simplified and more transparent ownership structure. In this new  structure, all shareholders of AINMT Holdings AB will be consolidated up into ice group AS, which effectively will own  100% of ice group’s Scandinavian business. The new and simplified ownership and business structure will result in a  more focused strategy for ice group. The ice group board of directors has therefore tasked the executive management  team to identify suitable actions and initiatives that will make ice group even more competitive in Scandinavia and  maximize long-term value creation for the company’s shareholders.    Eivind Helgaker was appointed CEO of the new ice group, consisting of operations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark,  on 23 August 2018.    Significant events during the period  ⁎ On 3 May 2018, ice group’s Norwegian operation entered into a new and improved national roaming  agreement (NRA) with Telia in Norway. The new NRA is valid for two years starting from 1 March 2018, with  an additional and conditional right to prolong the NRA for one year. The financial details of the agreement  remain confidential. The new agreement offers favourable conditions and, more importantly, a higher level of  flexibility for ice. The new NRA replaces the three-year agreement (plus an optional three-year period) ice and  Telia in Norway signed in February 2015. The NRA includes voice and data services on Telia’s 2G, 3G and  4G networks for all ice customers in Norway.   ⁎ In May 2018, network build-out in Norway reached 80% population coverage.  ⁎ On 23 May 2018, ice announced that it had reached 500,000 customers (415,000 mobile voice and data  customers, plus 85,000 mobile broadband customers), confirming its challenger position in the Norwegian  telecom market.  ⁎ On 6 June 2018, ice group’s Norwegian operation, ice, signed a contract with Nokia that provides the  framework to facilitate further network build-out in Norway at favorable terms for ice.  ⁎ On 15 June 2018, the parent company structure of ice group Scandinavian Holdings AS announced that it  had approved a legal restructuring and a demerger, separating its international businesses in Indonesia and  the Philippines from its Scandinavian businesses. The de-merger will enable the executive management to  focus all its efforts on its operations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. As a further result from the legal  restructuring, ice group AS will become the top parent company in the ice group, and sole shareholder of  AINMT Holdings AB, which in turn owns 100% of ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS.    ⁎ On 22 June 2018, NOK 500 million of the proceeds from the parent’s sale of its Brazil investment, was injected  as equity into ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS. The sale was a step in the legal restructuring with the  purpose is to fund further growth in Norway.    Significant events after the end of the period  ⁎ On 21 August 2018, the new board of ice group AS was elected, effectively becoming the new operating board  of directors of ice group.  ⁎ On 23 August 2018, ice group announced that all conditions for the de-merger of the group’s non- Scandinavian assets had been successfully met and the creditor notice period for the de-merger had expired.  On the same date, ice group AS filed for the completion of the de-merger with the Brønnøysund Register  Centre. The company expects the completion of the de-merger to be registered and effective within a short  time period.   ⁎ Managing director of ice in Norway, Eivind Helgaker, was appointed CEO of ice group on 23 August 2018.      SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2018                3  Personnel and organization    At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 197 versus 173 for the equivalent period the previous  year. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, the Group  employed 288 (265) people.    Investments    The Group’s acquisition of intangible and tangible assets during the second quarter amounted to NOK -196,174   (-289,201) thousands. The investments are mainly related to the smartphone network build-out project in Norway, both  on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems and radio access network expansion, and costs to obtain  and fulfil customer contracts.    As from 1 January 2018, ice group capitalizes costs to obtain and to fulfil customer contracts, which means that these  items are now recognized as investment expenditures instead of as previously as operating expenditures. As the  change of principle is applied retrospectively, the impact on the second quarter of 2017 investments were NOK -50,478  thousand while this quarter’s investment in new customers amounted to NOK -71,782 thousand. These are included in  the amounts above.    Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK 164 (-293) thousands.    EBITDA    Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the second quarter amounted to NOK 5,047 (18,046)  thousands. Non-recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade  and build-out. Please also see the Alternative Performance Measures reconciliation on page 10.    The implementation of the IFRS 15 reporting standard from 1 January 2018 has changed how and when certain  revenue and cost items are recognized, which has impact on ice group’s EBITDA. The effect from the new standard  on the Group’s EBITDA compared to previously applied principles for the second quarter 2017 amounted to NOK  23,371 thousand. More information is presented under the New and changed accounting standards in 2018 section,  page 8.    Reclassification of commission revenue    Since the purchase of Network Norway business customers in March 2015, commission revenue and related expenses  have been recorded gross within service revenue and operating expenses, in line with the accounting in Network  Norway prior to being acquired by ice. Ice has decided to change the accounting principle and instead recognise the  commission revenue net of expenses. The accumulated revenue impact for the second quarter 2017 amounted to NOK  -8,461 thousand, while the revenue impact for the half year amounted to NOK -15,961 thousand. EBITDA and/or  Operating Result are not affected. All comparative numbers have been updated to reflect the change, for further details  see page 8.    Risks and factors of uncertainty    Ice group Scandinavia’s operations are exposed to certain risks that could have a varying impact on earnings or its  financial position. These can be divided into industry, operational and financial risks; including regulatory and  competitive risks.    A material part of the ice group’s revenues and profits is derived from operations outside Norway. Currency fluctuations  may influence the reported figures in NOK. Please refer to the annual report of 2017 for a detailed description of the  risks identified.    Related party transactions    No related party transactions to report for the second quarter of 2018. For other items, see further details under the  section on critical accounting estimates and judgements in the annual report of 2017.    SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 2018                4  Outlook 2018    The Group expects to increase its mobile phone (smartphone) market share in Norway.    Legal disclaimer    Certain statements in this report are forward-looking and the actual outcomes may be materially different. In addition  to the factors discussed, other factors could have an impact on actual outcomes. Such factors include developments  for customers, competitors, the impact of economic and market conditions, national and international legislation and  regulations, fiscal regulations, fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates and political risks.        13 September 2018    The Board of Directors of ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS

Harvested  volumes were 12.9 thousand tonnes gutted weight.  The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 376.3 million. The farming  segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 393.2  million. The salmon spot prices increased in Q2 2018,  compared to the previous quarter. The price increase  had a positive effect on the operational EBIT in the  farming segment. The VAP segment made an oper- ational EBIT of DKK -16.9 million. The EBITDA for the  FOF segment was DKK 66.0 million.    The Group made a profit for Q2 2018 of DKK 338.8  million (DKK 398.1 million). For H1 2018, the profit  was DKK 611.1 million (DKK 477.1 million).    The total volumes harvested in Q2 2018 were 12,902  tonnes gutted weight (18,402 tgw). Total harvested  volumes in H1 2018 were 25,139 tonnes gutted  weight (31,560 tgw). Bakkafrost has reduced its  guidance for volumes for 2018 by 2,000 tonnes  gutted weight, from 51,000 tonnes to 49,000 tonnes  gutted weight.    2.8 million (1.9 million) smolts were transferred  during Q2 2018. In H1 2018 5.9 million (3.3 million)  smolts were transferred.    The combined farming and VAP segments made an  operational EBIT of DKK 376.3 million (DKK 435.0  million) in Q2 2018. The operational EBIT per kg in Q2  2018 was DKK 29.17 (DKK 23.64), which corresponds  to NOK 37.41 (NOK 29.77) for the combined farming  and VAP segments. For H1 2018, the combined  farming and VAP segments made an operational EBIT  of DKK 593.1 million (DKK 755.2 million).    The farming segment made an operational EBIT of  DKK 393.2 million (DKK 489.5 million) in Q2 2018. The  harvested volumes were lower, and the average spot  price was higher in Q2 2018, compared to Q2 2017.  For H1 2018, the operational EBIT was DKK 621.6  million (DKK 862.7 million).    The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK       -16.9 million (DKK -54.5 million) for Q2 2018. The VAP  segment has had negative results from Q2 2016 until  Q3 2017, when it turned to a surplus, but the salmon  spot prices increased again in Q1 2018, resulting in  negative margins. For H1 2018, the operational EBIT  was DKK -28.5 million (DKK -107.5 million).    The FOF segment (fishmeal, oil and feed) made an  EBITDA of DKK 66.0 million (DKK 47.8 million) for Q2  2018, and the EBITDA margin was 20.2% (15.1%). The  EBITDA was DKK 152.5 million in H1 2018 (DKK 93.0  million), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 24.3%  (15.6%).    During Q2 2018, Havsbrún sourced 118,387 tonnes  (163,100 tonnes) of raw material, and in H1 2018,  Havsbrún sourced 248,491 tonnes (269,667 tonnes)  of raw material.    In accordance with Bakkafrost’s dividend policy and  the resolution of the Annual General Meeting 2018,  Bakkafrost paid out DKK 10.50 (NOK 13.52) per share  on 30 April 2018. The total dividend payment was  DKK 513.0 million (NOK 660.6 million).    In Q2 2018, Bakkafrost’s full-time employees from  2017, still employed in Bakkafrost, have received  bonus shares with the value of 2% of their salary in  2017. In total, Bakkafrost allocated 14,206 shares to  its employees. The total allocation amounted to DKK  5.2 million and was based on the closing share price  on the allocation day, 14 June 2018.  Bakkafrost has through its recently established  subsidiary Bakkafrost US signed an agreement in Q2  2018 to acquire the business and assets in North  Landing, which is a US salmon importer focusing on  the East Coast and has a sales office, handling and  processing facilities in Clifton, New Jersey, USA.  Through the acquisition, Bakkafrost will have a better  market access and better abilities to serve Bakka- frost’s customers in the US market. The acquisition of  North Landing has been closed in Q3 2018.    Bakkafrost relinquished farming sites A-03 Svínáir  and A-17/18 Hovsfjørður in July 2016 to comply with  Faroese law, when acquiring the remaining outstand- ing shares in P/F Faroe Farming, which had farming  operations in Suðuroy, Faroe Islands. Faroe Farming  has since been merged with P/F Bakkafrost Farming.   Bakkafrost has been in dialogue with the Faroese  Authorities on how the farming operation in Suðuroy  could be structured. In Q2 2018, the conclusion was  made, which resulted in Bakkafrost relinquishing  farming site A-82 Kaldbaksfjørður and getting back A- 17/18 Hovsfjørður. In this restructuring Bakkafrost  will have future farming opportunities in A-23  Hvalbiarfjørður, which will be part of the farming site  A-15/16 Trongisvágsfjørður. Hvalbiarfjørður is a  frontier farming area where preliminary research has  been done. Bakkafrost will now start building up these  new farming sites.    The net interest-bearing debt amounted to DKK 443.3  million at the end of Q2 2018 (DKK 258.1 million at  year-end 2017). Undrawn credit facilities amounted  to DKK 1,039 million at the end of Q2 2018.     The equity ratio was 68% at 30 June 2018, compared  to 70% at the end of 2017.   BAKKAFROST | INTERIM REPORT | Q2 2018 AND H1 2018 4        Financial Review   (Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year)    Income Statement  The operating revenue amounted to DKK 954.3  million (DKK 1,206.1 million) in Q2 2018, and for H1  2018, the operating revenue amounted to DKK  1,805.5 million (DKK 2,059.8 million).    The farming segment’s harvest volume was lower, and  the achieved prices were higher in Q2 2018, com- pared to the same quarter last year. The VAP segment  had lower revenues because of lower volumes, but  higher prices in Q2 2018, compared to Q2 2017. The  FOF segment had higher external revenues in Q2  2018, compared to Q2 2017.     Operational EBIT was DKK 407.9 million (DKK 459.2  million) in Q2 2018. The VAP and FOF segments had  improved operational EBIT in Q2 2018, compared to  Q2 2017. For H1 2018, the operational EBIT was DKK  676.1 million (DKK 794.6 million).    The fair value adjustment of the Group’s biological  assets amounted to DKK 34.8 million (DKK 54.9 mil- lion) in Q2 2018. The positive adjustment is due to  higher forward market prices for salmon at the end of  the quarter, compared to the beginning of the quarter.  For H1 2018, the fair value adjustment amounted to  DKK 141.9 million (DKK -179.7 million).    Change in provisions for onerous contracts amounted  to DKK -6.1 million (DKK 25.1 million) in Q2 2018. For  H1 2018, the change in provisions for onerous  contracts amounted to DKK -6.1 million (DKK 55.2  million).    In Q2 2018, there was a profit from associated com- panies amounting to DKK -1.7 million (DKK -2.3  million). For H1 2018, the result from associated  companies amounted to DKK 0.7 million (DKK -0.1  million).    The revenue tax amounted to DKK -31.4 million in Q2  2018 (DKK -45.5 million). The revenue tax decreased  because of lower harvested volumes, compared to the  same quarter last year. For H1 2018, the revenue tax  was DKK -57.7 million (DKK -75.7 million).    Net interests in Q2 2018 were DKK 9.1 million (DKK    -4.9 million). For H1 2018, net interests were DKK          -9.6 million (DKK -11.2 million).    Net taxes amounted to DKK -73.8 million (DKK -88.4  million) in Q2 2018. For H1 2018, net taxes amounted  to DKK -134.3 million (DKK -106.1 million).    The result for Q2 2018 was DKK 338.8 million (DKK  398.1 million) and for H1 2018, the result was DKK  611.1 million (DKK 477.1 million).  Statement of Financial Position  (Figures in parenthesis refer to end last year)    The Group’s total assets amounted to DKK 5,470.3  million (DKK 5,155.5 million) at the end of Q2 2018.    Intangible assets are unchanged, compared to the  beginning of the year, and amounted to DKK 376.7  million at the end of Q2 2018. Intangible assets pri- marily comprise the fair value of acquired farming  licences. No licences in the North region are recorded  with a value in the Bakkafrost accounts.    Property, plant and equipment amounted to DKK  2,714.6 million (DKK 2,570.4 million) at the end of Q2  2018. In Q2 2018, Bakkafrost made investments in  PP&E amounting to DKK 131.1 million.     Non-current financial assets amounted to DKK 79.3  million (DKK 76.7 million) at the end of Q2 2018.    The carrying amount (fair value) of biological assets  amounted to DKK 1,107.3 million (DKK 1,096.7  million) at the end of Q2 2018. Biological assets have  increased due to higher fair value adjustment, com- pared to year end 2017. Included in the carrying  amount of the biological assets is a fair value adjust- ment amounting to DKK 328.9 million (DKK 187.0  million) at the end Q2 of 2018.

Prospects for 2015 Result management (as of 20 February 2015): Restamax estimates that the Group will reach a  turnover of over MEUR 100 during the 2015 finan- cial period, and that the EBITDA and operating  profit will increase proportionally compared to the  previous financial period. Q2 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues on next page Moderately good result for the second quarter of  2015 In January–June 2015, the turnover of our Group  increased almost 40 per cent from the previous  year, EBITDA over 60 per cent and operating profit  almost 130 per cent. Our result for the period under review was clearly  growth-oriented. However, the result for the Ap- ril–June period was not entirely as expected. The  exceptionally poor weather in early summer posed  many challenges for our summer restaurants. The  weather has affected our result in terms of both  the restaurant business and labour hire business.  A busy schedule of summer events has provided an  increasing amount of employment opportunities  in the labour hire segment, but there has been litt- le demand for extra workers. Due to investments and corporate acquisitions  carried out during the review period, the depre- ciable amount has increased slightly more than  expected. Although our operations have been faced  with many challenges due to the weather and the  general market situation, we achieved a fairly good  result in January–June. Numerous updates and new restaurants for the  summer season During the second quarter of 2015, we implemented  numerous investments, restaurant openings, re- vamps of restaurant concepts and renovations. In  April, we purchased the pub and restaurant com- pany Italpal Oy, whose restaurant concepts are  highly functional in this market situation. In May,  we strengthened our position in Lappeenranta by  opening the restaurants Daddy’s Diner and The  Grill in the new Iso Kristiina shopping centre At  the Mustalahti marina in Tampere, we opened the  remodelled restaurant Kaisla in early May and the  new Café & Pizzeria Ankkuri, which serves high- quality café products and Italian-style pizzas, in  June. In addition to this, we invested in opening several  seasonal restaurants and summer terraces, and ex- panded our operations to Hanko by purchasing the  business operations of two restaurants. We gained  possession of Restaurant HSF, which has been in  operation for over 75 years, and the southernmost  restaurant in Finland, Hangon Portti. Currently,  our range of more than 100 restaurants spans from  Hanko all the way to Pyhätunturi. Our seasonal  restaurants in the northern travel centres and in  the south complement each other extremely well.  They provide our customers with new experiences  and our staff with new ways of working. We updated several concepts to better meet the  varying needs in different municipalities. For  example, the Daddy’s Diner restaurants operating  at the Koskikeskus Shopping Centre in Tampe- re and in Seinäjoki were converted into American  Diner restaurants in May. Our desire was to st- rengthen the American Diner brand by expanding  the concept to new areas and business locations.  We believe that the clear business idea that draws  from American cuisine has plenty of capacity for  success in the above-mentioned locations and also  nationwide. Our Ravintola.fi loyal customer system inclu- des dozens of restaurants throughout Finland.  Through the system, we aim to increase our cus- tomers’ commitment to us and create diverse res- taurant experiences. By virtue of the updated and  newly-opened restaurants we can provide our lo- yal customers with a wider selection of services  and added opportunities for utilising benefits in  more locations than before. Our loyal customer  system is under constant development and we be- lieve its role as a marketing channel will continue  to increase. Beginning of the year slightly better than ex- pected in the field The tourism and restaurant industry is going  through its fourth difficult year. The sale of alco- hol is on the decline, and the increase in the sale of  food has slowed down. Still, the early part of 2015  has been slightly better than expected for compa- nies in the field. The sales of restaurants licensed  to serve alcohol are estimated to have increased by  1.5 per cent during the first quarter of the year. Ac- cording to the current estimation, the sale of food  has increased while the sale of alcohol has declined  further. In 2014, the turnover of restaurants licen- sed to serve alcohol increased by 1.2 per cent, whe- reas the turnover increase in 2013 was 1.6 per cent.  Q2 Continues from previous page According to the trend survey conducted by the  Finnish Hospitality Association MaRa in May, the  turnover of restaurants is expected to remain at  the level of the previous year during the summer  and early autumn, despite the promising early part  of the year. Even though the consumer’s confi- dence in economic growth is at its highest in four  years, private consumption is expected to increase  at a historically slow rate in the coming years. The  field’s expectations regarding economic trends  have improved slightly but remain cautious. Ex- port is expected to pick up slightly over the course  of 2015, which is anticipated to boost domestic de- mand later in the year. Labour hire operations strengthening their  position Labour hire became part of our operations in the  2014 financial period. Although the process of in- corporating the labour hire segment into our Group  is still underway and the business operations are  still in the early stage, we have seen plenty of evi- dence of the segment’s potential for growth during  the early part of the year.  The Restamax subsidiary Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut  Oy expanded its heavily restaurant-oriented ope- rations to medical and health care services. Estab- lished at the beginning of April, Smile Doctors Oy  focuses on supplying and hiring out doctors. The  wide and growing health care market creates good  growth opportunities for a company specialising in  supplying doctors.  During the period under review, Smile Henkilöstö- palvelut also signed important partnership agree- ments. One of the most important ones is the ser- vice agreement made with the leading timeshare  company in Europe, Holiday Club Resorts Oy. The  agreement strengthens Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut  Oy’s position in its current market areas and opens  up growth opportunities in brand new areas. The  value of the agreement is estimated to amount to  approximately MEUR 20 in total over the next 5–7  years. According to statistics, the demand for temporary  employees and the turnover of labour hire activi- ties is increasing constantly. The sector offers both  employers and employees flexible opportunities.  The new generations are open and willing to wor- king flexibly in different companies and sectors.  As a result, a new way of working has emerged  alongside long and permanent work careers: wor- king for short periods in the employ of different  companies. According to Sitra’s estimate, these atypical emp- loyment relationships already constitute 35 per  cent of employment relationships and provide  work for approximately 800,000 Finns. This num- ber includes part-time and fixed-term workers,  private entrepreneurs, temporary and contract  workers hired out by labour hire companies, and  hourly workers who are called to work as needed.  According to the Private Employment Agencies’  Association HPL, the number of part-time emplo- yment relationships has increased dramatically in  Finland over the past two decades, and in 2014 one  in seven employees worked part-time. Positive growth prospects Despite the fact that that the demand for restau- rant services remains uncertain, poor weather  conditions have had a significant impact on our  operations and competition in the field is fierce,  we have been able to expand our business ope- rations. At the same time, we have been able to  maintain good profitability, which is clearly above  the average profitability within the industry.  Based on the first half of the year, it seems high- ly likely that we will achieve the goals set for this  year and a turnover of over MEUR 100.

INTERIM REPORT Q2/2014 Q2 RESTAMAX INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORT Q2/2014 TURNOVER GREW 19.8 PER CENT IN JANUARY–JUNE 2014 April–June 2014 in brief Figures in parentheses refer to the same period  last year, unless otherwise stated. The Group’s turnover was MEUR 20.5 (MEUR  15.2), growth of 34.7 per cent. The EBITDA was MEUR 2.1 (MEUR 1.6), growth  of 29.0 per cent. The operating profit was EUR  479,100 (EUR 406,000), growth of 18.0 per cent. January–June 2014 in brief The Group’s turnover was MEUR 36.4 (MEUR  30.4), growth of 19.8 per cent. The EBITDA was MEUR 3.5 (MEUR 2.9), growth  of 22.0 per cent. The operating profit was EUR  566,400 (EUR 383,400), growth of 47.7 per cent. Prospects for 2014 Profit guidance (unchanged since 5 March 2014): Restamax estimates that the 2014 turnover will  increase to MEUR 86–97. The company estimates  that the 2014 EBITDA will increase to MEUR 14.5– 16.3 and the operating profit to MEUR 8.7–10.4. The company’s goal is to reach a turnover of  MEUR 100 by the end of 2015.  With the corporate investments made during the  two first quarters of 2014, the company estimates  it will come close to meeting this goal already in  2014. The growth speed of Restamax has been upbeat  throughout its history. Last year’s focus on  stock exchange listing slowed our growth slight- ly. The two first quarters of 2014 demonstrate  that our restaurant company will once more see  growth this year.  The listing supporting our growth strategy and  the related share issue have enabled invest- ments that bring us competitive advantage in  the future. A significant amount of these invest- ments will be realised during 2014.  Significant investments in the first half of 2014 In March 2014, the biggest corporate acquisi- tion in the company history complemented the  restaurant portfolio of Restamax with 16 new  restaurants, when the company acquired the  Rengasravintolat Group. With this acquisition,  we strengthened our position, among other  things, in the Helsinki metropolitan area and  expanded our operations to a new market area,  Pori.  The most significant step towards growth taken  in the second quarter of 2014 was concluding a preliminary agreement for a joint venture  company with the Rukakeskus Group in June.  With the agreement, the restaurant operations  of Rukakeskus Plc and its subsidiary Pyhätunturi  Plc at Rukatunturi in Kuusamo and at Pyhä- tunturi in Pelkosenniemi will be transferred to  the ownership of the joint venture company in  October 2014. Restamax will own 65 per cent of  the Tunturiravintolat joint venture company and  Rukakeskus 35 per cent. This acquisition solidly  supports the company’s strategic expansion to  the touristic attraction centres of the north. Other significant events of the period include  new restaurant openings, such as Restaurant  Villisika in Hämeenlinna, the Chicago Food Park  restaurant mix in the new Lielahti Centre in  Tampere, the Rikhards Gastropub and Välimäki  restaurants in Helsinki and the Little Joe restau- rant boat and the Daddy’s Gelato ice cream bar  in Tampere. In addition, with the establishment  of Soolo Max Plc, we expanded our operations to  Kotka. The economic downturn of the restaurant bu- siness continues The restaurant business is struggling in a down- turn and the demand for tourism and restaurant  services has clearly decreased in comparison  with last year. The share of alcohol consumpti- on in restaurants has dropped to a historically  low level and the increase in the alcohol tax  that took effect at the beginning of this year has  CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN: continues on next page Q2 further decreased the domestic serving demand  of alcohol. Furthermore, food sales in restau- rants licensed to serve alcohol is decreasing  and the poor weather in the early summer has  impacted the operations of summer restaurants  negatively. Reasons behind the field’s weakening  profitability and dropping sales include not only  the loss in purchasing power of households but  also weakening company sales. In addition, the  decrease in the numbers of foreign and domestic  travellers, heavy cost structure and continuous- ly tightening taxation create challenges for the  field.  According to forecasts by the Finnish Hospitality  Association (MaRa), no quick recovery is in sight  and the field’s downturn will continue at least  until the end of the year. A turn for the positi- ve can, however, be seen in the reinstitution of  deductible representation expenses that allows  companies to deduct half of their representation  expenses starting next year. This decision will  support the demand for tourism and restaurant  services, increase employment and, thus, bring  tax revenues to the state. Supporting employment as a goal The tourism and restaurant field is a significant  employer in Finland. In this field, the share of  labour costs is approximately 30 per cent of the  turnover. Weak demand especially increases the  unemployment of young people, since nearly one  third of the industry’s labour is under the age of  26. The Extraordinary General Meeting of Resta- max held on 29 July 2014 approved the Board  of Directors’ proposal regarding the purchase  of the Staff Invest Group’s labour hire service  operations and also of certain of its subsidiaries  that provide labour hire services. The corporate  acquisition covers approximately 75 per cent of  the business operations of the whole Staff Invest  Group, and the entity acquired will be joined to  the Restamax Group starting 1 August 2014 and  reported as a segment of its own in the future.  The General Meeting also confirmed the chan- ging of Restamax’s Articles of Association so that  labour hire services are added to the company’s  field of operations. We want to do our share in supporting the emp- loyment of young people and we see great busi- ness potential in the field of labour hire services  in the future. Restamax has solid competence  in the restaurant business and also plenty of  experience in part-time employment relation- ships that are typical in the industry. With the  Staff Invest corporate acquisition, Restamax will  become a bigger employer than before. We want  to offer our employees better opportunities to  advance in their careers and to work in a goal- oriented fashion. The company owns several  restaurants in many cities, which allows us to  offer same employees more work in different  restaurants. With the Staff Invest corporate ac- quisition, we ensure the sufficient availability of  staff in future and strengthen the growth of our  company. Restamax has been the biggest cus- tomer of Staff Invest Plc and, with the corporate  acquisition, the profit margin of the hired labour  working in Restamax’s own restaurants remains  in the Group. Upcoming events Although the general financial situation in Fin- land has continued to be unstable and costs have  continued to climb, their effects on the demand  of the company’s products and services have  been relatively small. Despite the challenging  general economic situation, Restamax has been  able to maintain good profitability, clearly above  the average profitability within the industry.  Today, our Group comprises over 80 restaurants  all over Finland; nightclubs, restaurants, pubs  and cafés. In June 2014, Restamax purchased the Matkai- lutalo property, forming an essential part of the  Tampere city centre milieu, for office and com- mercial building purposes. We are anticipating  the transfer of our head office to this protected  building in the heart of the city this autumn.  Besides office facilities, we will open two high- class restaurants in the property in the near fu- ture. This building important in terms of cultural  history designed by Carl Höijer in 1896 to serve  as the office building of Tampereen Verkatehdas  is, thus, given new life.  Restaurant openings of the following period  include the expansion of the Space Bowling &  Billiards concept to Pori and the Stefan’s Steak- house restaurant opening in the heart of Jyväs- kylä. Our goal is to reach a turnover of MEUR 100 by  the end of 2015. The two first quarters of 2014  have shown that we are getting close to this goal  already this year.

The EBITDA was MEUR 2.1 (MEUR 1.6).  The Group’s operating profit was EUR 479,100 (EUR  406,000).  The Group’s income for January–June 2014 Restamax’s turnover for the period of six months  was MEUR 36.4 (MEUR 30.4), an increase of 19.8  per cent over last year. The EBITDA was MEUR 3.5  (MEUR 2.9). The Group’s operating profit was EUR  566,400 (EUR 383,400), growth of 47.7 per cent. As expected, the income of the review period was  slightly better than that of last year. The EBITDA  also increased slightly from the same period last  year. The reasons behind the increase in turnover  are the Rengasravintolat and Gastromax invest- ments made in the first quarter of the year. A  significant number new of openings took place in  the first half of 2014, so most of their profits will be  made in the latter half of the year. Due to the seasonal nature of the restaurant busi- ness, most of the profits are made at the end of the  year. The Group’s net operating cash flow between  January and June was EUR 693,500 (MEUR –1.4).  During the review period, Restamax has made  significant corporate acquisitions and growth in- vestments, including the purchase of Gastromax  Plc and the acquisition of the Rengasravintolat  Group. In addition, the company concluded a pre- liminary agreement with the Rukakeskus Group  for the establishment of a joint venture company.   The group’s interest-bearing net liabilities at  the end of June were MEUR 12.0 (MEUR 8.8). The  net financial expenses in January−June were EUR  169,013 (EUR 280,444). The equity ratio was 57.8  per cent (39.6 per cent) and gearing ratio 33.1 per  cent (68.4 per cent). Dividend On 23 April 2014, Restamax’s Annual General  Meeting decided that for the financial period that  ended on 31 December 2013 a dividend of EUR0.09  per share be paid based on the adopted balance  sheet. The divided was paid on 8 May 2014. Authorisation to purchase the Company’s own shares The Annual General Meeting decided to authorise  the Board to decide on the purchase of 800,000  of the Company’s own shares at the maximum,  using the unrestricted equity of the Company,  in one or several tranches, under the following  terms: The shares shall be purchased in trading on the  regulated market in Helsinki Stock Exchange, and  therefore the purchase will take place by private  placing and not in relation to the shares owned  by the shareholders.  The sum paid for the shares  is the price announced on the acquisition day for  Restamax Plc’s shares on the regulated market  on the stock list of Helsinki Stock Exchange. The  shares are purchased in trading organised by  NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Oy in accordance with its  rules and regulations. The shares can be pur- chased for financing or carrying out possible ac- quisitions or other arrangements, to implement  incentive systems within the Company, or for  other purposes decided by the Board.

PROSPECTS FOR 2016 Result management (as of 23/02/2016): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  and profitability to remain on a good level in the 2016  financial year. RESTAMAX SIX-MONTHLY REPORT  1 JANUARY–30 JUNE 2016 TURNOVER INCREASED AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVED IN JANUARY–JUNE 2016 Q2/2016 CEO MARKKU VIRTANEN Continues on next page A successful quarter puts us back on the  path to growth Between January and June 2016, the turnover of the  entire Group increased by more than 16 per cent,  EBITDA increased by over 25 per cent and operating  profit by almost 30 per cent from the correspond- ing period the previous year. In the previous review  period, i.e. the first quarter of 2016, our result was  poor. The result in the second quarter, on the other  hand, shows that we have been able to get back onto  the path of growth. Although the generation of profit  in the restaurant sector and the labour hire sector is  focused on the end of the year, profit for the second  quarter was good. Behind the result is the successful launch of our  summer restaurant business. The warm and sunny  weather in late spring and early summer had  a positive impact on demand for our services, and  operating conditions for the restaurant business  were good. Our result was however affected by the  costs of integrating new restaurant businesses and  labour hire companies, which have balanced out since  the review period. Strongly involved in the Helsinki area During the first half of the year, we strongly expanded  our restaurant business in the Helsinki area. At pres- ent in the market area in question, Restamax already  has 15 restaurants and two Wayne’s Coffee franchising  cafeteria companies. At the beginning of April, we  acquired the Namu and Showroom restaurants in  Helsinki. In April, in Helsinki we also opened the  Hook restaurant, which has acquired a reputation in  Tampere for its chicken wings, and the Lintsi American  Diner restaurant at Linnanmäki. We almost tripled the  size of our Hernesaaren Ranta business by increasing  the number of customer seats from 1,200 to 3,500.  In May, we strengthened our range of restaurants  with Helsinki Mexican restaurants, when the Cholo,  Patrona and Lucha Loco restaurants and the food truck  Taco-bot joined our Group. In May too, in Hanko we  opened a Stefan’s Steakhouse at the HSF restaurant  and we renovated the restaurant’s interior and terrace  to give it new credibility. The nightclub world in  Lappeenranta also received a newcomer in April, when  the Union Work & Leisure Club opened in the heart of  the city. Operationally, the summer season for restaurants in  the Helsinki area started well. For example, the Lintsi  American Diner, which opened on the site of the  Midhill restaurant at Linnanmäki but larger in terms  of space and number of seats, increased its turnover  in the second quarter significantly and restaurant  business at the Hernesaaren Ranta has also been quite  brisk. Growth prospects for the restaurant business lie in  centres of growth and commerce, where there is  strong demand for restaurant and other leisure  services. The fast-food restaurants in the Helsinki  area are expected to create thousands of new jobs in  the coming years. In future, we will also strengthen  our position in the market of the Helsinki area in  accordance with our growth strategy. Positive economic prospects The economic prospects in the tourism and restaurant  sectors have been exceptionally gloomy over the past  four years. Now at last, the situation in the sector looks  brighter. According to the Finnish Hospitality Associa- tion MaRa, turnover in the restaurant field increased by  4.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2016. According to a  forecast by MaRa, restaurant turnover increased by 5.1  per cent in the second quarter of this year. In the first half of the year, the Finnish economy  grew more than was expected, and all in all, the  summer season is expected to be good. According  to an economic survey carried out by MaRa in May,  most companies in the sector believe that summer  sales will increase. Moderate growth in sales is also  expected to continue for the rest of the year. The  improved economic situation has not, however, been  reflected in the sales of alcohol in restaurants, the  decline of which continues. According to a forecast  Q2/2016 by MaRa, alcohol sales in the first half of the year fell  by almost 1 per cent, whilst sales by food restaurants  increased by 6 per cent. The reform of alcohol legislation, which will enter into  force next year, will make things easier for restaurants  by reducing bureaucracy and aiding customer service.  This alone, however, will not be enough. In order for  the share of alcohol sales in restaurants to achieve a  much needed boost, the value added tax applicable  to it must be considerably reduced.  According to forecasts by MaRa, in spite of the positive  prospects growth in purchasing power will slow down  towards the end of the year, and the growth in private  consumption is expected to halve next year. So from  the point of view of the development of the restaurant  sector, economic growth and improvement in   purchasing power and employment, tax reductions  enabled by the competitiveness agreement will be  necessary next year. The Finnish government has proposed to Parliament  reform of food legislation, by which domestic  legislation that is stricter than EU directives would  be repealed in the near future. If the reform brings  much-needed relief to reporting and statutes,  this will be positive news for food restaurants. Turnover for labour hire growing strongly In the review period just gone, turnover in the labour  hire segment continued strong growth. The purchases  by the present customer base of our subsidiary Smile  Henkilöstöpalvelut Oy developed positively and the  stock of contracts has strengthened. Operations  have also been taken into new fields, whose growth   prospects are quite favourable. In May, the labour hire business was expanded  geographically when Smile bought the majority of  shares in Make My Solutions Oy, which is based in  Seinäjoki. The main markets of the company now  operating under the name Smile MMS Oy are South  Ostrobothnia and Northern Finland. As a result of  the transaction, the labour hire business was also  expanded into the fields of industry, construction  and logistics. Smile Industries Oy was established for  new fields of business, and is focusing on the national  expansion of operations. In the review period gone by,  labour hire for corporate events was entirely focused  on Smile Event & Promotions Oy. During the summer,  the sector employs up to 1,000 people. The integration  of new sectors and companies into the business of the  segment had an impact on our result for the period  under review. The strong path of growth in the labour hire sector  continues. The total value of the market in Finland  is about EUR 1.5 billion, and the total turnover of the  field was over a billion euros in 2015, two-thirds of  which consists of labour hire. In comparison with   the previous year, the total turnover of the labour  hire sector increased in May 2016 by more than 22  per cent, and the turnover of labour hire services   by more than 14 per cent. The total value of the   cumulative turnover of labour hire in January-May  2016 was MEUR 317.27, which represents growth of  13.3 per cent over the previous year. Development stronger than general  market development A target set by our company’s Board of Directors  for the strategic period 2016–2018 is to expand the  restaurant business abroad, both through corporate  acquisitions and organically. Taking operations to  new market areas outside Finland is presently at  the investigative stage. At the same time, we will  grow our business in domestic markets, both in the  restaurant business and labour hire. The development of our turnover, both in the restaurant  business and labour hire, has been considerably  stronger than general market development. At the  same time, our profitability has remained clearly  better than the average level of profitability in the  sectors. I believe that the favourable development and  profitable growth of our business will also continue  for the rest of the year.

SIX-MONTHLY REPORT Q2/2017 Q2/2017 RESTAMAX SIX-MONTHLY REPORT  1 JANUARY – 30 JUNE 2017 STRONG DEVELOPMENT IN TURNOVER – RESTAMAX SPECIFIES ITS RESULTS  MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR 2017 APRIL–JUNE 2017 IN BRIEF Entire Group: The Group’s turnover was MEUR 43.6 (MEUR 31.9),  growth of 36.4 per cent.

PROSPECTS FOR 2017 Results management (as of 8 August 2017): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  by approximately 30 per cent from the previous year  to approximately MEUR 170 in the 2017 financial  period. Profitability is estimated to remain at a good  level in 2017. The Company’s long-term strategic goal is to reach a  turnover of MEUR 180 by the end of 2018. Previous results management (as of 21 February  2017): Restamax expects the Group’s turnover to increase  and profitability to remain on a good level in the 2017  financial year. The Company’s long-term strategic goal is to reach a  turnover of MEUR 180 by the end of 2018. Q2/2017 Continues on next page Strong development in turnover between January  and June 2017 – specifications to the profit forecast In terms of profit, the second quarter of 2017 did  not meet our expectations. The growth in turnover  was good, but profitability deteriorated in relation to  the previous year. As regards the labour hire busi- ness, the review period was successful despite strong  growth and related integration costs. The restaurant  business suffered significantly due to the exception- ally poor weather in early summer. Between January  and June 2017, the turnover of the entire Group in- creased by 27.7 per cent, EBITDA by 1.7 per cent and  operating profit by 18.3 per cent from last year. Despite the challenging start to the summer, we  achieved a moderate result and the long-term  outlook is good. We will get close to the 2018 turno- ver goal of MEUR 180 over the course of the 2017  financial period. As a result, we will be specifying  our results management scheme by virtue of this  six-monthly report. We estimate the turnover for the  2017 financial period to be approximately MEUR 170,  indicating a growth of approximately 30 per cent.  Furthermore, the profitability is expected to remain  at a good level. Cold weather in early summer weakens profitability  The exceptionally cold and rainy weather in early  summer hampered our summer restaurant opera- tions, which is clearly evident in the relative profit- ability of the review period. According to statistics,  the month of May was coldest in decades, and early  June is normally this cold only once every ten years  on average. In June, rainfall in central and southern  Finland was 1.5–2 times higher than the average. The weather conditions had a significant impact on the  demand for our summer restaurant services as well as  the turnover and EBITDA of our entire restaurant sec- tor, which fell well behind the levels of the correspond- ing period of last year. About 70 of the 120 restaurants  owned by our Group feature terraces. This translates  to nearly 15,000 outdoor seats. We made significant  growth investments in our seasonal restaurant opera- tions, with regard to which we are expecting profits to  materialise later in the summer and upcoming seasons. In April we expanded our restaurant operations  by acquiring the business operations of Ruoveden  Rantaravintola and Muroleen Kesäkahvila. Over the  course of May and June, we opened Restaurant Enso  in Helsinki, the wings restaurant Hook in Turku, the  Pepe Lopez terrace restaurant in Pori as well as the  Ranta restaurant complex in Tampere. In addition to  this, we purchased the majority shareholding in Pub  Harry’s, which operates in Jyväskylä. Growth in the restaurant sector continues still  driven by food sales During the first half of the year 2017, the sales of the  hospitality companies continued the steady growth  that was sparked last year. Although accommoda- tion providers have grown faster than restaurants,  the development in the restaurant sector also looks  cautiously promising. The growth is supported by an  increase in both foreign and domestic tourism and  the positive general trend in the Finnish economy.  In addition to this, the prospects are bolstered by the  relatively high consumer confidence. However, the demand for restaurant services was  encumbered by the poor weather conditions early  in the summer. According to a turnover forecast by  the Finnish Hospitality Association MaRa, restau- rant turnover increased by 5.4 per cent in the sec- ond quarter of this year. During the second quarter,  the turnover of Restamax’s restaurant operations  increased by 10 per cent. The turnover of the entire  hospitality sector is expected to stand at 6.7 per cent  for the first half-year period. Although the sales of restaurants licenced to serve  alcohol increased in the second quarter of the year,  the favourable development is increasingly attribut- able to food sales; people consume as much alcoholic  drinks as before but largely at home and outdoors.  Passenger import remains dominant among sales  channels. Despite the positive overall trend, the hospitality  field continues to be marred by poor profitability.  Companies’ costs have skyrocketed due to the increase of the wholesale prices of food and alcoholic TEMPORARY CEO JARNO SUOMINEN Q2/2017 Continues from previous page drinks as well as labour costs. In addition to this,  high tax rates are holding back any improvements in  profitability. However, the economic barometer for  the field indicates that steady growth will continue  and even increase slightly in the coming months. Another season of strong growth in labour hire For the labour hire business, the review period was  successful. Labour hire is an increasingly impor- tant part of our Group’s operations, and growth and  development in the sector are stronger than in our  restaurant business.  During the review period, the growth of Smile Hen- kilöstöpalvelut was accelerated by an acquisition  in April, through which Pasianssi Oy (Banssi Hen- kilöstöpalvelut) was incorporated into the Group.  The subsidiary, which currently operates under the  name Smile Banssi Oy, has operations in 14 cities.  The acquisition strengthens our labour hire opera- tions nationwide, especially in the fields of industry  and construction. In the beginning of July after the  review period, Smile acquired the share capital of Job  Services One Oy. The labour hire company operating  in Tampere and Turku focuses on direct recruitment,  providing staffing services for construction, industry  and the service sector. The acquisition lends itself to  bolstering our labour hire operations even further in  the Pirkanmaa and Southwest Finland regions. In ad- dition to corporate acquisitions, organic growth was  strong due to successful acquisition of new custom- ers and increased customer purchases. The consolidation of operations and the corporate  restructurings have generated approximately EUR  150,000 in non-recurring items and integration costs,  which affect the segment’s result for the review  period. The result is encumbered by the development  of other operations, in relation to which the synergy  benefits will be fully achieved at a later time. The  decreased demand for restaurant services is naturally  also mirrored by the Group’s labour hire services. Generally speaking, the labour hire business has  been able to successfully adapt to the changes in the  employment climate by consolidating a variety of  fragmented opportunities to form more expansive  arrangements. This is evident in the strong growth  of the labour hire business. Sales numbers and staff  numbers in the field have remained at a good level,  as have the expectations of companies. The clearest indicator of the promising development  is turnover. According to the Private Employment  Agencies’ Association HPL, the increase of turnover  in the field between January and April in 2017 was 14  per cent compared to the corresponding period of the  previous year. The growth rate of the employment  services has only been trumped by the construction  sector. The turnover of Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut for  the January–June period increased by 73.5 per cent  over the previous year. Smile also aims to contribute  to the strong growth through the Pasianssi and Job  Services acquisitions. Expanding the organisation’s pool of competence We will strengthen our management during the latter  part of the year through new appointments. Juha  Helminen will assume his duties as our new CEO in  September from his previous position as Vice Presi- dent of Trade at Oy Sinebrychoff Ab. At that point, I  will step down from my position as temporary CEO to  continue as the CFO for the Group. We will also strengthen our Executive Team with two  new appointments. Tomi Söderström will begin as  the Director of Operations on 18 September 2017. He  will transfer to our Group from the HYY Group, where  he has served as the Director of Hospitality Business.  Previously, he was in charge of restaurant operations   on Tallink Silja cruise ships. Tero Kaikkonen, who  has served as the Product Line Director for food  restaurants in our Group since 2013, will step in as  the Group’s Development Director on 1 September  2017. These additions to our roster will increase our  competence and international expertise, which will  support our grown and goals of expanding our busi- ness abroad.  Peak share price Our share price development has been very good in  recent years and particularly during the past review  period. In addition to dividends, we have been able to  Continues on next page Q2/2017 provide our investors with excellent returns thanks  to our increased share price. Our share price has in- creased by approximately 70 per cent since our list- ing in 2013 and the beginning of trade. The highest  peak in share price occurred in mid-June, at which  point the price stood at EUR 9.16. This is an indica- tion of strong confidence in our operations among  investors and the market. In both of our business segments, profits are largely  made late in the year. Although the result for January–  June 2017 did not meet our expectations, we will  continue our significant growth in turnover and  maintain our good profitability during the latter half  of 2017.

The restaurant segment is expected  to reach a turnover of over MEUR 200, and in labour   hire, a turnover of approximately MEUR 110 is ex- pected, the total turnover being some MEUR 300  after eliminations. Restamax will further specify its long-term financial  targets during the 2018 financial period. Previous results management  (as of 20 February 2018): In accordance with its strategy, Restamax expects  the Group’s turnover to increase and profitability to  remain on a good level in both segments in the 2018  financial period. The restaurant segment is expected  to reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 140 and  in labour hire, a turnover of approximately MEUR 110  is expected, the total turnover being some MEUR 240  after eliminations. Restamax’s goal is to reach a turnover of approxi- mately MEUR 400 by the end of 2020 after internal  eliminations. The goal of the restaurant segment is to  reach a turnover of approximately MEUR 200, and the  goal of the labour hire segment is to reach a turnover  of approximately MEUR 220 by the end of 2020. Q2/2018 Continues on next page Second quarter of 2018 makes Finnish restaurant  history The second quarter of 2018 became an important  milestone in the history of both the company and the  entire Finnish restaurant business. In June, we made  the largest corporate acquisition in the history of the  Finnish restaurant business, as Restamax purchased  Royal Ravintolat. By joining forces, the two restau- rant pioneers became the country’s largest restaurant  company, with a total of some 220 restaurants in  Finland and Denmark. The integration of Royal Ravintolat has started well  and is expected to continue throughout next year.  Now, looking at the company from the inside, I see  two companies with various and supplementary  strengths that we can utilise to achieve significant  benefits from synergy and scale. In our estimate, the  synergy benefits gained by the Group will total at least  MEUR 6 by the end of 2019. These will result from re- moving overlaps in administration and management,  achieving scale benefits in purchase and acquisition  volumes as well as improving staff efficiency. To en- able efficient completion, we have strengthened our  organisation and appointed a new Executive Team  for the Group with members from both companies. I  started as the CEO of Restamax and Chairman of the  Executive Team on 1 June 2018. My predecessor Juha  Helminen takes charge of our company’s internation- al operations and their development. The composition  of the Group’s Board of Directors was revamped on 1  June 2018, and the new Executive Team will begin on 1  September 2018. As expected, the integration of restaurant operations  in Denmark has also started well. Two new restaurants  have now been opened at Copenhagen Airport, and we  are currently looking into expansion opportunities in  the Danish restaurant market. In addition, we are con- ducting negotiations about openings in a few markets. Joining forces to become Northern Europe’s largest   Two big Finnish restaurant entrepreneur stories uni- fied in the beginning of June. One of Finland’s fastest- growing listed companies, Restamax, has experienced  strong, steady growth throughout its history (2006– 2017 CAGR +32%). At the same time, the company has  managed to keep profitability at a good level.    The roots of Restamax’s operations date from the  mid-1990s and, during 12 years in the hands of its  present chief shareholders, it has grown from a  company with a turnover of MEUR 8 to a Group of  almost MEUR 190. Royal Ravintolat, in turn, has been  a pioneer in Finnish cuisine for nearly 30 years, basing  its corporate culture on high quality and an entrepre- neurial operating model.   The success stories of both companies are based on  strong entrepreneurship, the resulting quick decision- making and controlled risk-taking as well as dedicated,  passionate people. I regard reinforcing this culture  as one of the most important success factors of our  future. Together, we form a restaurant company that  combines an entrepreneurial approach in everything  we do, an attitude that emphasises the role and profit  responsibility of restaurateurs as well as a big com- pany’s development resources and benefits of scale.   The competence areas and market strengths of the  new company will also complement each other well.  Royal Ravintolat’s strong market position in Helsinki  and Restamax’s foothold in key Finnish cities and sea- sonal hotspots will guarantee an excellent position in  Finland’s growing restaurant market, which is becom- ing increasingly consolidated. The companies’ pools  of competence also complement each other – whereas  Royal Restaurants’ high customer satisfaction and  loyal customer relationships are its competitive as- sets, I consider Restamax’s experience and operative  efficiency the best in the market in terms of quality.   CEO AKU VIKSTRÖM Q2/2018 Continues from previous page With its market leadership in the growing restau- rant business and its proven growth strategy, the  company has a good growth platform for continuing  domestic market consolidation and developing its  profitability. This also enables achieving new growth  through internationalisation. In the next 3–5 years,  our goal is to become the largest restaurant company  in Northern Europe. The Group’s strong and profitable growth continues   In terms of profit, January–June 2018 was highly suc- cessful. The turnover of the entire Group increased by  62 per cent, EBITDA by nearly 66 per cent and operat- ing profit by nearly 104 per cent from the correspond- ing period in the previous year. The Group’s strong  growth is still continuing and its relative profitability  is developing positively. In the period under review, we made exceptionally  many transactions and that affected our result. Our  result was adversely affected by the capital transfer  taxes from corporate acquisitions, totalling approx.  MEUR 1.45. In addition, non-recurring costs relat- ing to the transactions, such as legal expenses and  consulting services, totalled approx. EUR 770,000 in  both business segments combined. In April, we sold  our approx. 30 per cent holding in SuperPark, which  operates indoor activity parks. A sales profit of ap- prox. MEUR 3.6 was recorded for this. The transaction  had a positive effect on our result and will support the  financing of our future growth. The positive total net  effect of the costs and profits of these transactions on  our result was approx. 1.4 million euros. A strong restaurant portfolio and proven, well- working strategy have been driving our growth for  10 years now. Our extensive restaurant portfolio now  covers Finland’s most interesting and heavily grow- ing markets in terms of both geography and customer  segments. At the same time, its diversity makes it less  dependent on external factors, such as weather. General economic development and change in con- sumer behaviour regarding the consumption of  services and eating out can be seen as positive market  development. The warm weather in the early summer  resulted in positive customer flows in various summer  events, amusement parks, terrace restaurants and,  in particular, seaside restaurants in Helsinki. Tourist  flows are also still increasing in Helsinki city centre  and Tampere. Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut’s position in the labour  hire market strengthens Smile Henkilöstöpalvelut became part of Restamax in  2014. Back then, the company’s turnover was approx.  MEUR 6.8, whereas it was MEUR 76.5 in 2017. The busi- ness growth rate has been wild – and it is not slowing  down. Smile is further strengthening its position as the  leader in Finland’s labour hire business. In the second quarter, Smile supplemented its organic  growth with significant corporate acquisitions, buy- ing 80 per cent of the construction-sector hired labour  company Adicio Oy and purchasing the Jobio companies  specialising in industrial, construction and logistics  labour hire services as well as Job Services Two Oy and  Job Services Three Oy, which operate in the Helsinki  Metropolitan Area. The company also signed a staff- ing services contract worth MEUR 100 with Restamax,  making Smile responsible for Restamax’s labour hire,  direct recruitment and payroll services also in the future.  The contract further reinforces Smile’s position in the  HoReCa sector, and the acquisition of Royal Ravintolat  strengthens the company’s foothold in the labour hire  market in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, in particular.  Smile plays a significant role in the integration of Royal  Ravintolat. By collaborating with Smile, we will ensure  the availability of professional labour as well as efficient  HR administration and its continuous development. Demand and growth continue in the labour hire sector.  According to the Confederation of Finnish Industries’  economic barometer of April 2018, the labour hire sector  has reached a record level, exceeding the high levels of  2005–2007. New parties and capital investors are inter- ested in the market, and consolidation can be seen in the  sector. In the past year, Smile has taken significant ef- forts to strengthen its market position, including raising  its national profile by means of marketing and investing  in its staff competence and customer commitment.
