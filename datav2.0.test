Our project portfolio contains both small molecules that are orally active immunomodulatory agents and antibody based immunotherapy. Laquinimod, licensed to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., is in clinical Phase II development for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, a rare neuro­ degenerative disease with a high medical need. ANYARA, licensed to NeoTX Therapeutics Ltd., is being developed to treat solid tumors. In addition, activities are conducted to identify strategic and competent partners for ensuring the continued development of tasquinimod in multiple myeloma, paquinimod for systemic sclerosis and the early preclinical projects in the SILC program. Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulatory investi- gational drug with a novel mechanism of action, preventing neurodegeneration and inflammation in the central nervous system. Laquinimod is being developed for daily treatment of Huntington’s disease, a rare neurodegenerative disease. Currently, a Phase II study in Huntington’s disease is ongoing with results expected in second half of 2018. Laquinimod has been granted orphan drug designation for this indication by the FDA, which provides for seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Active Biotech has an agreement with the Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd since 2004 covering the worldwide development and commerciali- zation of laquinimod. ANYARA is a tumor-targeting immunotherapy that enhances the ability of the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. Active Biotech has an agreement with NeoTX Therapeutics Ltd since October 2016 for the global development and commercialization of ANYARA for the treatment of cancer. trial of ANYARA combined with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced cancer. Preparations are in progress to commence a clinical Tasquinimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulatory compound that reduces a tumor’s ability to grow and spread. Tasquinimod is being developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a rare form of blood cancer with a high medical need. Patents in key markets have been granted, providing protection for the use of tasquinimod in malignant blood disorders, specifically acute forms of leukemia and multiple myeloma, until 2035. Further- more, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for tasquinimod for the treatment of multiple myeloma, which provides for seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Tasquinimod shows compelling data in experimental models of multiple myeloma and the next step is to confirm proof of concept in a clinical Phase I/II study. Active Biotech is now seeking a collaboration partner for the further development of tasquinimod. S100A9 is expressed in the tumor microenvironment SILC (S100A9 Inhibition by Low molecular weight Compounds) is a preclinical immuno-oncology project focused on S100A9 as the target molecule for the treat- ment of cancer. and is involved in the development of cancer through recruitment and activation of specific immune cells that counteract the T cells’ ability to attack and eradicate the tumor. S100A9 is also involved in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches and in the formation of new blood vessels, which provide nutrition and oxygen into the growing tumor. Small substances that block the function of S100A9 could represent a new therapeutic alternative to help the body’s own immune system fight cancer. Chemical libraries of substances have been screened for binding to this target molecule and lead substances with good properties for further development have been identified. Three international patent applications have been filed for the purpose of obtaining patent protection for three, chemically unrelated, substance groups, and patents from two patent families have been granted to date in Europe and the US. Active Biotech is seeking a collaboration partner for the further development of the project. Paquinimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulatory Paquinimod shows potent effects on fibrosis and compound in development for treatment of systemic sclerosis, a rare autoimmune disease of the connective tissue with a high unmet medical need. inflammation in several experimental models of systemic sclerosis and has been granted orphan drug designation in both the EU and the US, which provides for ten and seven years, respectively, of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. Active Biotech is seeking a collaboration partner with expertise to further develop paquinimod in systemic sclerosis. ●●●● 4 C O M M E N T S F R O M T H E C E O 2017 Comments from the CEO 2017 was a challenging year of negative events in the MS project with laquinimod. At the same time, I am pleased with what we have achieved in other projects where important interim goals for continued development have been achieved. 2017 was the year that we were looking forward to positive results with laquinimod from the two ongoing MS studies. To our disappointment and that of many others, these expectations were not realized. We announced with our partner Teva in May that the primary endpoint in the CONCERTO study in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) – reducing disability progression in patients measured by EDSS – had not been met. This was a regrettable result that was crucial to the further development of laquinimod in MS. The results from the ARPEGGIO Phase II study of laquinimod in primary progressive MS (PPMS) were announced in December. The study did not show any difference for the primary endpoint of brain atrophy between the group that received laquinimod treatment and the group given a placebo. Accordingly, the results could not justify continued clinical development of laquini mod in PPMS. All in all, this meant that following a comprehensive program TEVA ended the development of laquinimod in MS. However, the clinical development of laquinimod in Huntington’s disease will continue and the Phase II study of LEGATO­HD is progressing according to plan with results expected in the autumn of 2018. During the year, we demonstrated together with NeoTX, our partner for ANYARA, that the combination of ANYARA and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, for example, Keytruda, generated clear additional effects in preclinical tumor models. These results support both new patent applications and the future clinical develop­ ment of ANYARA. Preparations are now being made to commence a clinical study in ANYARA toward the end of 2018. In our other projects, we pursued commercial and value­creating activities in 2017 to support continued development and partnership agreements. Financing In February 2018, the Board of Directors decided to imple- ment a new rights issue of approximately SEK 48 million before issue costs. The rights issue is being conducted to ensure financial sustainability in order to await the outcome of clinical studies and to conduct negotiations with partners around the projects. The rights issue was over subscribed by approximately 30 percent and provides the company with approximately SEK 48 million before issue expenses. The company’s existing cash and cash equivalents and liquidity supplement from the ongoing sale of the company’s property are expec- ted to finance operations according to the current business plan. Laquinimod The CONCERTO study was designed based on the results of the two previously conducted Phase III studies, ALLEGRO and BRAVO in RRMS. In these studies, laquinimod displayed an explicit effect on slowing disability progression (Confirmed Disease Progression, CDP) when assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Being able to evaluate the effect as a primary endpoint in a major study was attractive since it could give laquinimod advantages in the market compared with registered therapies. Contrary to previous studies, the results of CONCERTO showed no effect on CDP, although the secondary relapse- related endpoints and MRI parameters were met in line with previous studies. Following extensive analysis of the study data from all Phase III trials, there is still no full explanation for the results of the CONCERTO study. In general, it can be said that CDP is a challenging clinical endpoint since relatively few such events are normally achieved during a limited study period, which could have contributed to the lack of effect on the primary results of the study. With patents secured in key markets and orphan drug status granted for tasquinimod in multiple myeloma, we have created highly favorable conditions for the continued advancement of tasquinimod. 5 C O M M E N T S F R O M T H E C E O The ARPEGGIO Phase II study was a proof of concept study, whose primary aim was to show the therapeutic benefit of laquinimod in patients with PPMS. The primary endpoint, brain atrophy, as defined by percent brain volume change from baseline to week 48, was not met in the study. The time to CDP, a secondary endpoint, was also not met. The study results were deemed not to justify continued development of laquinimod in PPMS. Ultimately, this meant that Teva will not continue the development of laquinimod in MS. This decision is naturally a disappoint- ment after extensive clinical development in MS where laquinimod displayed clinical efficacy combined with a favorable safety profile. At the same time, only one of the three pivotal studies achieved the primarily endpoint, which significantly disadvantaged the regulatory potential for laquinimod in MS. Teva will continue to develop laquinimod in Huntington’s disease, a rare neurodegenerative disease, with a very high medical need for treatment targeting the actual disease. Laquinimod has shown positive effects in preclinical models for Huntington’s that could be of importance in slowing the neurodegenerative process that is typical for Huntington’s disease. The LEGATO-HD Phase II study is the first study with laquinimod in this indication and is randomized and placebo-controlled and evaluates the daily doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg laquinimod as a potential therapy for patients with Huntington’s disease. The study was fully enrolled before the summer 2017 and the results will be available in the second half of 2018. At the beginning of the year, the FDA granted laquinimod orphan drug status for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, which allows seven years of market exclusivity in the event of future registration. ANYARA Extensive preclinical data was generated in the ANYARA project during the year, demonstrating the combination effects of ANYARA and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda which is a PD-1 inhibitor. The results support the hypothesis that ANYARA can enhance the effect of such therapy by increasing the immune system’s ability to recognize the tumor. The preclinical results led to new patent applications to protect the use of ANYARA in this combination. If these patents are granted, they would provide potential extension of ANYARA patent protection until 2036. Preparations for a clinical study of ANYARA in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with vari- ous forms of advanced cancer are ongoing and the study is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2018. Tasquinimod In the past year, tasquinimod was granted patents for use in multiple myeloma in both Europe and the US. With patents secured in key markets until 2035 and orphan drug status granted in multiple myeloma, we have now created highly favorable conditions for the continued advancement of tasquinimod. Although new treatments have greatly improved prognosis and survival of multiple myeloma patients, there is still a significant need for new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as tasquinimod. Discussions with clinical experts and potential partners in relation to the continued clinical development and commercialization of the project are ongoing. SILC and Paquinimod During the past year, we secured product patents in the US for two of three patent families in the SILC project. Work aimed at clarifying the role of S100A9 as a target molecule in immuno-oncology is proceeding and data from the SILC project was presented at the scientific meeting ”Tumor Models” in London at the beginning of December. We are currently focusing on demonstrating proof of concept for SILC substances in humanized tumor models, which is important for the continued commercial activities in the project. Commercial activities are in progress in the paquinimod project to identify a new partner for continued clinical development in systemic sclerosis, where paquinimod has orphan drug designation in both the US and Europe. Closing words As I look back at the past year, I can say that it has been a challenging year with decisive, negative events in the MS project with laquinimod together with our partner Teva. At the same time, I am pleased with what we have achieved in other projects, where we attained important milestones for continued development. In 2018 I am looking forward to the results of the LEGATO study and recommencing the clinical development of ANYARA. Furthermore, we will focus on continuing to develop value in the tasquinimod, paquinimod and SILC projects. In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our employees and shareholders for your loyal support over the past year. Helén Tuvesson, CEO

For the Annual General Meeting in May, the Nomination Committee of AAK AB proposed new election of Mikael Ekdahl as Chairman of the Board and Gun Nilsson and Bengt Baron as Board members. The Annual General Meeting resolved in accordance with the proposal. Following the strategy to broaden our nutritional focus we delivered our first volumes of Akovita® in June. Akovita® is our new product range for the senior nutrition market and contains ingredients such as plant sterol esters which are clinically proven to maintain and even reduce the cholesterol level in the blood which is supported by Article 14(1) health claim in the EU. In July, our CEO and President Arne Frank suddenly and very unfortunately passed away. Arne joined AAK in 2010 and developed AAK into a world-leading player in the market for value-adding vegetable oils and fats. The smallest business area, Technical Products & Feed, reported an operating profit of SEK 84 million (100), a decrease by 16 percent. Operating profit per kilo decreased by 17 percent, to SEK 0.30 (0.36). Operating cash flow including changes in working capital amounted to SEK 1,099 million (1,213). Cash flow from working capital was negative, amounting to SEK 388 million (negative 263). Good working capital management has impacted cash flow favorably. However, this was offset by a continued organic volume growth, a net nega- tive impact from higher raw material prices, and working capital tied up for our new factories in Brazil and China. Earnings per share increased by 19 percent, to SEK 28.24 (23.71). Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), calculated on a rolling 12 months basis, was 15.6 percent (15.8). ROCE declined due to increased raw material prices which impacted the first six months in 2017, investments in Brazil and China, and the acquisition of California Oils Corporation in 2016. Our new speciality and semi-speciality edible oils factory in Zhangjiagang, China was officially inaugurated in September. With the new plant in operation, we have taken a major step forward in our global growth strategy and it brings us closer to our customers in yet another key market. The fully automated, multi-oil and multi-process plant has an initial production capacity of 100,000 MT per year, and opens up many new possibilities for our customers in China in a wide range of applications. In November, AAK’s Board of Directors appointed Johan Westman as new President and CEO of AAK AB. Prior to joining AAK, Johan was Senior Vice President Europe and Managing Director of the BlankLight division at Shiloh Industries, a global innovative solutions provider to the mobility market with headquarters in Valley City, Ohio, USA. Johan will start no later than June 1, 2018. At the end of December, we signed our first commercial contract for TROPICAO™, our chocolate solution for hot climate markets.

Halting climate change requires a fundamental transformation of the world's energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. DONG Energy is the energy company in Europe which has come the furthest in the transition to renewable energy, and 2016 was yet another important milestone. The Group's earnings from Wind Power doubled to DKK 11.9 billion and for the first time exceeded earnings from oil and gas production. We installed 0.6GW of new offshore wind capacity and completed the conversions of two CHP plants in Aarhus and Copenhagen to sustainable biomass. The Group's CO2 emissions have been halved relative to 2006, and our goal is for DONG Energy to phase out coal completely by 2023. The transformation of our business to increasingly more renewable energy also means becoming more international. Today, we are constructing and operating offshore wind farms in Denmark, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, while also maturing new projects in the USA and Taiwan. In June 2016, we completed an IPO, the biggest in Danish history, and in December 2016, DONG Energy was included in the OMX C20 index on Nasdaq Copenhagen. I would like to thank both Danish and international investors for the trust which they have shown our company. In November 2016, we decided to initiate a process aimed at divesting the Group's oil and gas production activities. The decision should be seen in light of our desire to become world-leading in green energy. We have created a strong and competitive oil and gas business in the North Sea. The time has now come to find new owners who can provide the best possible conditions for developing this business area. Our efforts to improve safety continued in 2016, and the injury frequency was at a record low. Making DONG Energy an even safer workplace is a key priority for the Board of Directors. We will therefore continue our efforts to improve safety standards to ensure that everybody working for DONG Energy – our employees and our business partners – get safely through their working day. Profit after tax for the year was DKK 12.2 billion for the continuing operations – the best result ever in the history of DONG Energy and a significant increase compared to 2015. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank our management and employees for the significant results achieved in the past year.

We want to revolutionise the way we power people by developing green, independent and economically viable energy systems. By doing so, we create value for the societies that we are a part of and for all our stakeholders. The way we work is based on five guiding principles: Integrity We are open and trustworthy and uphold high ethical standards Results We set the bar high, take ownership and get the right things done Passion We are passionate about what we do and proud of what we achieve Safety We never compromise on health and safety standards Team We value diversity and collaborate in a non-hierarchical, respectful and trusting way Integrity is our root.

Today, more than 80% of the world’s energy supply comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which leads to serious climate change and impacts people’s living conditions all over the planet. If we are to slow down this development, we need to supply the world with energy in a sustainable manner. Over a period of 11 years, Ørsted has been transformed from a Danish utility company based on coal, oil and gas to an international energy company based on green energy. In 2017, we decided to phase out our use of coal by 2023, and we divested our oil and gas business. We also guaranteed our Danish resi- dential customers that the power they receive from us is generated by offshore wind farms. With the decisions we made in 2017, we com- pleted our strategic transformation from black to green energy. None of the other major en- ergy companies in Europe have come this far in their transformation processes, and among this group, we are now the fastest-growing company. As a result, we are a completely different company today. That is why we de- cided to change our name to Ørsted, inspired by the world-renowned Danish scientist H.C. Ørsted. Our vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. We have strong competences within sustainable energy solutions in all parts of our “With the decisions we made in 2017, we completed our strategic transformation from black to green energy. None of the other major energy companies in Europe have come this far in their transfor- mation processes. business. We want to build on these strengths and help the world’s transformation to green energy systems. Our commitment to sustainability is funda- mental. We therefore run our business in a way that supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In our Sustainabil- ity Report, you can read more about how we contribute to these goals. The heading for our strategy is ’Green growth’. In the coming years, growth will primarily be driven by our build-out of offshore wind, where we have the largest investment programme in the sector. We are also looking into new growth opportunities within green energy generation, intelligent customer solutions and solutions integrating generation and consumption. per share, enabling us to retain an attractive level of dividend. In 2017, we continued our tireless work to im- prove safety for our employees and suppliers. We achieved a lost-time injury frequency of 1.6, the lowest level ever in the Group’s history. On this basis, we are now switching to an even more fine-meshed measuring method comprising all accidents, whether they lead to absence or not. Profit for the year from continuing operations amounted to DKK 13.3 billion, our best ever result. The Board of Directors recommends to the annual general meeting that dividend payments be increased from DKK 6 to DKK 9 On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank the management and employees for having created one of the most successful energy companies in Europe, and one that is leading the way towards a world which runs entirely on green energy.

Making strides in smokeless Much has changed since Swedish Match was listed as a publicly traded company in 1996. Back then, our smokeless tobacco busi- ness consisted of chewing tobacco and moist snuff in the US, and snus in Scandinavia. Snus and moist snuff combined were about as big as chewing tobacco in terms of sales, and together, snus and moist snuff accounted for about one-eighth of company sales. Today, Swedish Match is truly a different company with a truly dif- ferent vision. Dramatically higher sales for snus and moist snuff, an emerging snus business in the US, and opportunities for the intro- duction and development of traditional and modern forms of smokeless tobacco worldwide are only a few of the phenomenal changes over the years.

Vi har revideret årsregnskabet for 2CureX ApS for regnskabsåret 1. januar - 31. december 2016, der om- fatter resultatopgørelse, balance og noter, herunder anvendt regnskabspraksis (”regnskabet”). Grundlag for konklusion Vi har udført vores revision i overensstemmelse med internationale standarder om revision og de yderlige- re krav, der er gældende i Danmark. Vores ansvar ifølge disse standarder og krav er nærmere beskrevet i revisionspåtegningens afsnit ”Revisors ansvar for re- visionen af regnskabet”. Vi er uafhængige af selskabet i overensstemmelse med internationale etiske regler for revisorer (IESBA’s Etiske regler) og de yderligere krav, der er gældende i Danmark, ligesom vi har op- fyldt vores øvrige etiske forpligtelser i henhold til disse regler og krav. Det er vores opfattelse, at det op- nåede revisionsbevis er tilstrækkeligt og egnet som grundlag for vores konklusion. We have audited the Financial Statements of 2CureX ApS for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2016, which comprise income statement, balance sheet and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies (”the Financial State- ments”). Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna- tional Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additio- nal requirements applicable in Denmark. Our re- sponsibilities under those standards and require- ments are further described in the ”Auditor’s re- sponsibilities for the audit of the Financial State- ments” section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Internatio- nal Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require- ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Ved udarbejdelsen af regnskabet er ledelsen ansvar- lig for at vurdere selskabets evne til at fortsætte drif- ten; at oplyse om forhold vedrørende fortsat drift, hvor dette er relevant; samt at udarbejde regnskabet på grundlag af regnskabsprincippet om fortsat drift, medmindre ledelsen enten har til hensigt at likvidere selskabet, indstille driften eller ikke har andet reali- stisk alternativ end at gøre dette. Revisors ansvar for revisionen af regnskabet Vores mål er at opnå høj grad af sikkerhed for, om regnskabet som helhed er uden væsentlig fejlinforma- tion, uanset om denne skyldes besvigelser eller fejl, og at afgive en revisionspåtegning med en konklu- sion. Høj grad af sikkerhed er et højt niveau af sikker- hed, men er ikke en garanti for, at en revision, der ud- føres i overensstemmelse med internationale standar- der om revision og de yderligere krav, der er gælden- de i Danmark, altid vil afdække væsentlig fejlinforma- tion, når sådan findes. Fejlinformationer kan opstå som følge af besvigelser eller fejl og kan betragtes som væsentlige, hvis det med rimelighed kan forven- tes, at de enkeltvis eller samlet har indflydelse på de økonomiske beslutninger, som brugerne træffer på grundlag af regnskabet. In preparing the Financial Statements, Manage- ment is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in pre- paring the Financial Statements unless Manage- ment either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. Som led i en revision, der udføres i overensstemmel- se med internationale standarder om revision og de yderligere krav, der er gældende i Danmark, fore- tager vi faglige vurderinger og opretholder professio- nel skepsis under revisionen. Herudover: As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identificerer og vurderer vi risikoen for væsentlig fejlinformation i regnskabet, uanset om denne skyldes besvigelser eller fejl, udformer og udfører revisionshandlinger som reaktion på disse risici samt opnår revisionsbevis, der er tilstrækkeligt og  Identify and assess the risks of material misstate- ment of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit pro- cedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 3

The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2010 was at a par with the corresponding quarter in the strong period of 2008. In Sweden and Germany, our two major countries of operations, we successively improved our profitability and also Norway saw a recovery. During the year, Finland and the UK recorded substantial growth with healthy profitability and in Denmark, efforts continued with restructuring aimed at attaining profitability. In 2010, our profits were impacted by additional expenses in three major customer projects in Sweden and Norway. We have gained extensive knowledge from the finalization of these projects and have refined our control and follow-up processes. Business development with IT I note a clear difference regarding change projects in comparison to previous upswings in the economy. Previously, these were often regarded as IT projects run primarily by the IT department, but this is no longer sufficient for success. The business and the IT department must collaborate more closely to succeed with challenging change projects. In many companies and organizations a fear of initiating demanding and costly projects prevails. Many are carrying a history of less successful changes in their baggage and are hesitant to enter into something new and time consuming. It is easy to understand their apprehension. At Acando, we are skilled at supporting our customers with the aim of placating fears and showing the way forward. A strong culture exists in Acando to deliver lasting value to customer businesses and to realize value quickly for every single assignment. Our consultants meet the customers in senior teams in which varied skills and experience in business development and IT collaborate. We prefer to work together with the customers’ employees, which is of crucial importance in the analysis phase to be able to understand the market challenges faced by customers, either at their customers or in their own organization. Just recently, I received gratifying evidence that our consultants and the methods we use are highly appreciated. We signed an agreement with the Nobel Foundation regarding the development of IT support for the Nobel Foundation’s work with the Nobel Prize Ceremony, the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm and the planning of the program for the Nobel Week. Prior to the development phase, Acando has assisted the Nobel Foundation with creative analysis to clarify the needs and to produce a joint system solution. It is an honor and tremendously exciting to have the opportunity of working with the management of the Nobel Foundation on such a stimulating project. Creating confidence All our major projects are initiated by utilizing our particular methodology for rapid project starts. This provides greater confidence and forms a key foundation of the ongoing work. At this stage, fears often change to expectations and a feeling CEO’s report Orchestrating change In 2010, there was a clear recovery in the market. The signals we had observed in the first half of the year were amplified in the second half and many of our customers wanted to discuss quick measures to support growth and expansion in preference to focusing on cost control and efficiency. Then suddenly, a significant number found they were pressed to keep pace with the increasing tempo in the market. 5 CEO’s report of confidence, direction and speed pervades. Our ability to collaborate with customers with a well-orchestrated approach, crossing several disciplines and processes feels more resilient and more relevant than ever. Our business consulting area is growing increasingly strong, assignments are becoming increasingly advanced and with increasing frequency are of an international nature. This is noticeable, in particular, in the Enterprise Architecture field where we have been awarded major assignments in several countries in the public and private sector. Together with our customers, we clarify how they can be supported in their business challenges by an altered architecture and information model. Our staff includes some of the leading architects in the field and they are particularly skilled at creating reliable long-term structures. Assignments include one from the Norwegian Defense to define their reference architecture based on NATO’s Architecture Framework and SOA policies and an order from a global industrial conglomerate for an architecture framework that will ensure that decision makers at all levels will more easily understand the consequences of planned and unplanned changes. These two assignments alone show our breadth in this field. Measuring to control Business Intelligence is another business area that has performed well over the year and within Business Intelligence, Performance Management in particular. We define and implement control and measurement models to create well-substantiated supporting material for decision making as part of the customers’ continued work with change. Understanding profitability in customer and product segments is central for making the right investment decisions. Our solutions have been well-received by the market and it is gratifying that we have established ourselves as a strong contender in the bank and finance sector. We have also succeeded in taking a significant position in respect of Microsoft Dynamics CRM solutions, with traditional and cloud-based delivery. We have exported our CRM capability to several of the Group countries and established ourselves in the private and public sector as well as obtained a number of new customers. Stronger demand for business systems We have achieved great success with both SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX during the year. It is with great satisfaction that I note that our ability to run complex business system projects has produced results. We have utilized our entire skills base, from business development to system expertise and thus succeeded in establishing ourselves as one of the absolute top major contenders in this field. We have just completed one of our most extensive projects for Swedish Match, where we implemented Microsoft Dynamics AX including the industry specific solution for the process industry. Our team consisted of senior business consultants and solution experts who worked in close collaboration with Swedish Match on this initiative since October 2009. An exciting year We will continue to develop and, as I mentioned earlier, orchestrated change has never been more important. I look forward to more substantial and complex undertakings and to us broadening our range of services in the countries in which we operate. Over the year, we have had the benefit of being able to work closely, both with established and with new customers, which fills us with energy and satisfaction on a daily basis. I can only hope that in addition to delivering results through our projects; we can contribute to realizing the same feelings with our customers. The order status at the start of 2011 is satisfactory and we are continuing with our ongoing work to improve margins to sustainably deliver satisfactory operating profits. Efforts primarily comprise an intense focus on sales and on operative resource management and delivery. We are continuing to increase the pace of recruitment to meet increasing demand, at the same time of course, the growing economy means intense competition for skilled employees. Thank you I would like to conclude by thanking all of our committed employees. I appreciate the dialogues we have with one another regarding how best to meet our customers’ needs in regard to the challenges they face or how we should further improve efficiency in our organization. You are all my personal heroes and every time I meet a customer who describes the understanding and commitment you all show, I feel very proud. I would also like to thank all of Acando’s customers, partners and shareholders for the great trust and support you have shown Acando during an exciting 2010. Carl-Magnus Månsson President and CEO

These open spaces were connected by a network of narrow lanes (sikka) which allowed residents convenient and shaded passage through the neighbourhood. Built around the concept of community, self-sufficiency, safety, social integration, the "fereej" provided a stable and sustainable lifestyle.  However, the introduction of electricity, cold stores, motor cars, telephones, newspapers, radio and television since the 1950s, has slowly but surely changed this traditional way of life. As a responsible corporate citizen, BNH is committed to supporting the local community and improving the quality of life for Bahraini citizens. This commitment extends to preserving Bahrain’s rich heritage and traditional way of life. We therefore actively support initiatives that seek to build cohesive and sustainable communities, protect the environment, save historical architecture, and preserve local customs. 02 03 As the theme for this year’s annual report, we feature the traditional Bahraini neighbourhood known as the "fereej". Today, few "fereejs" still exist, either in towns or in the countryside, but most have disappeared in the wake of remorseless urban development.

Therefore, for the full year, we reported an increase in operating profit from existing operations* of more than 40 percent compared with 2010. *      Excluding operations in Denmark which were divested in the third quarter. **    The Board’s proposal to the AGM. 4 Ceo’s report 2011 – A successful year for Acando 2011 was a year characterized by healthy demand in the majority of our markets. As a result of this, we increased net sales to SEK 1,524 m during the year, which corresponded to an increase of 6 percent measured in local currency. Furthermore, by successfully increasing the proportion of deliveries in project form and enhancing the efficiency of our delivery processes, we significantly improved our profitability.  Operating profit, excluding costs attributable to the divestment of operations in Denmark, was SEK 125 m, an increase of 40 percent. A healthy cash flow and a strong financial position enabled the Board of Directors to propose raising the dividend to SEK 1.00 per share, corresponding to a total disbursement of about SEK 72 m to our shareholders. Close Acando has a strong position in the market, with a broad customer base in the private and public sectors. Our customers are spread across many industries thus enabling us to shift focus over the business cycle. We work with our customers in a joint team towards jointly established goals. Geographic proximity is a fundamental concept and we endeavor to promote close dialog and adapt the pace and methods to fit the customer’s prerequisites. We embrace the concept of closeness as a crucial component of customer dialogs team on a daily basis. During the year, we contributed to making hundreds of customers faster, more efficient and even more competitive. Time and time again, I am humbled and grateful for the trust given us by our customers. Comprehensive During the year we clarified our offering in three domains: Business Development, Business Systems and IT Solutions. Our promise of sustainable business enhancements through information technology has been proven in many projects. An increasing number of business processes depend on technology and these processes impact not only the customer’s employees but also their customers, partners and suppliers. As increasingly complex volumes of data are made available; a need is being created for qualified solutions for analysis and decision-making. Our offering has never been stronger or more relevant. Our fundamental concept for creating sustainable benefit is that the implementation comprises three core components to ensure the intended effect; understanding of the strategic direction, the efficiency of the proposed solution and a high degree of usability for the solution. Industrialized As our assignments increasingly become project-based implementations, our customers are setting higher requirements for predictability and guaranteed results. A decisive success factor for us has been creating peace-of-mind in parallel with the application of a thorough and adapted methodology, including everything from lean-based assignments in completely new environments to agile implementation methods dominated by traditional methodology. We create peace-of-mind by working in shorter cycles, being the best at visualization and concretization and by never giving up – Passion for Improvements. CEO’s report Close, Comprehensive and Industrialized – Elegantly! ”Some conversations are clearly remembered. At the start of 2011, I received a call from one of our most experienced consultants. “Can you come with me and meet the Nobel Foundation?” she asked. A few months later, our solution for planning and implementing the Nobel Week was successfully tested and in its evaluation, the Nobel Foundation summarized the work in a manner that essentially describes Acando’s business concept, ‘An ability to understand needs through joint creative analysis, to translate those needs into a modern, future-proof and elegant solution in combination with confidence-inspiring implementation. „ 5 Ceo’s report Team spirit, Passion, Results Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all of Acando’s employees, who have passionately embraced challenges, both large and small, at our customers while maintaining a focus on results for the customer. I would particularly like to thank you for remaining professional, understanding and committed in all dialogs, both with customers and with each other; you make me proud. You are my heroes! Also it was nothing if not inspirational to see some of you at your finest during the Nobel Week! 2012 – the next chapter is being written We will continue to press ourselves and accept challenges from all our customers. While we stand humbled by the external business environment - which impacts us all – we also stand confident in our own abilities. Our market offering is equally attractive, whether needs are driven by expansion and growth, or whether it is streamlining and consolidation that top the agenda. We are securing increasingly challenging assignments and we always want to offer customers the finest consultants. To manage this we need to expand our ranks. We will remain an attractive workplace and, during the year, we will invest additional energy in utilizing each employee’s full potential. We will continue to focus on customer results and we are convinced that this will also enable us to create returns for our shareholders. With a finely-honed organization and many exciting and challenging projects ahead of us, I cautiously look forward to an exciting 2012 together with our customers, partners, employees and shareholders.

The business concept is to provide telecommunications services, including wireless data services, voice, messaging, mobile broadband services, telephony and other related telecom services. Ice Norway’s primary spectrums are now in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands. These were acquired in December 2013 and the Group’s Norwegian business is now a fully-fledged mobile network operator offering data, voice and messaging services. The mobile broadband services in both Norway, Sweden and Denmark utilize the low-frequency band 450 MHz. For our customers, this means access to mobile broadband with almost full geographical coverage. The Company is wholly owned by AINMT Holdings AB, Sweden, (the “Parent Company”) which is owned approx. 61% by AI Media Holdings (NMT) LLC, Delaware, and approx. 39% by ice group AS, formerly AINMT AS, Norway. ice group AS is listed at N-OTC with ticker “ICE”. Significant events during the year The majority of ice group’s significant events in Scandinavia in 2017 were related to the Norwegian operation, where ice is Norway’s third largest network operator and provider of wireless data, voice and messaging services, challenging the duopoly of Telenor and Telia. Ice is also Norway’s third largest provider of wireless broadband services. At the beginning of the year, ice had a total market share (B2C and B2B) of 5.1% for voice services, based on number of subscriptions. The company’s customer base increased organically throughout the year, confirming that Norwegian customers find ice’s product attractive and competitive. The customer base was further boosted in the third and fourth quarter, when the B2C customer base of Hello was acquired. By the end of October, more than 40,000 customers had been migrated to ice, in line with the ambitions for the acquisition. The organic customer growth in Norway has been supported by disruptive and customer-centric initiatives, and a strategy of operating openly and honestly with easy-to-understand subscription packages without any hidden fees. As an example of disruptive offerings, ice was the first company to launch data roll-over to all its mobile phone consumer customers – a move that was extremely well received amongst its customer base. All other Norwegian mobile phone operators have since followed suit. Since then, ice also included data roll-over for its B2B as well as mobile broadband customers, making it the only company in Norway to offer data roll-over to all of its customers. Thereafter, in December, ice was the first operator to introduce data rollover sharing – allowing customers to share excess data with any Norwegian ice customer of their choice. The company aims to continue challenging the major players through launching new and innovative products. Within mobile broadband, ice won important B2B contracts during 2017. In September, ice signed an important deal with the Norwegian police, which will use ice as a secondary supplier to deliver mobile broadband for a period of up to five years. In October, ice signed a contract with NSB Passenger trains to provide mobile broadband services to its 185 trains. Strengthening the financial position and reducing annual financial costs of ice group’s Scandinavian operation was also a key priority in 2017. First, it completed a refinancing in March, consisting of a NOK 1.4 billion secured bank facilities and NOK 800 million senior unsecured bond which combined with the ANNUAL REPORT 2017  BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT 3 full redemption of its current SEK 1.5 billion bond yielded increased flexibility. In connection with the refinancing the Parent Company injected NOK 830 million of equity into ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS. Moreover. In September ice group’s Scandinavian operation further increased its financial flexibility when it successfully placed a new four-year NOK 1.4 billion senior secured bond issue, which refinanced the outstanding committed secured bank facilities of NOK 1.4 billion. In addition, NOK 200 million of equity was injected into ice group Scandinavia Holdings AS on 28 June 2017 by the Parent Company, with the purpose of funding further growth ambitions in Norway, both in terms of customer acquisition and network and IT infrastructure build-out. Throughout the year, ice continued building out the 4G network. As a result, the Norwegian operation increased its average smartphone data on-net traffic from 13% in Q1 to 31% in Q4, representing important cost savings for the Group. In November, ice was elected “mobile phone operator of the year” at Inside Telecom’s annual conference as a recognition of the company’s progress in 2016 and 2017. At the end of December, ice announced that it would change its brand name from ice.net to ice. The brand change was successfully implemented early January 2018. Removing the “.net” and the wifi symbol from its name and logo, and replacing it with an ice crystal, reflects the fact that network coverage in Norway is today a matter of course and that customers should expect the same, excellent 4G network coverage with ice as with any other operator. Ice wants to differentiate itself by how it treats its customers and how ice can make customers’ everyday life easier. Financial resume and key ratios NOK thousands 2017 2016 Service revenue1   1,241,917 859,204 EBITDA   -463,021 -248,081 CAPEX    -583,528 -487,035 Total assets   3,320,368 2,858,351 Operating margin %   Neg Neg Equity/assets ratio %   16% 21% 1)  Service revenue and operating expenses for 2016 have been restated due to commission revenue reclassification. No effect on EBITDA and net profit. See page 13 for more information. See note 31 for definitions. EBITDA Non-operational items identified during 2017 amounted to NOK 70,732 (67,170) thousands. Nonoperational items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the network technology upgrade and Smartphone migration, redundancy and expenses related to share-based compensation. Please also refer to note 7 Alternative Performance Measures. Significant events after the end of the period Early January 2018, ice.net in Norway re-branded to ice. On 6 February 2018, ice group’s Swedish subsidiary Netett Sverige AB (“Net1”) won the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority’s frequency auction for the national license of 2 x 5 MHz in the 450 MHz band. The term of license is from 5 March 2020 up to and including 31 December 2044. Net1 already fulfils the required license conditions. Obtaining this license provides the foundation Net1 needs to continue developing its mobile broadband offering in Sweden and expand into the machine-to-machine market and IoT segment. The amount of SEK 40.2 million for the license was paid in March 2018. ANNUAL REPORT 2017  BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT 4 Future developments The Group continues to invest in network capacity and to simplify and extend the service offers on all markets while keeping a tight cost structure. New technical solutions are continuously evaluated. In 2018, a key priority for the Norwegian operation is the network roll-out and optimization to increase population coverage from 40% to approximately 80% during the first six months of 2018, and thereby further increase the on-net traffic. The plan for the network roll-out is to increase the amount of 4G base stations from 1,200 to almost 2,000. Network clusters will be optimized, and on-net activated as soon as the roll-out is complete in each specific area. The short-term ambition is to reach approximately 80% population coverage mid-year 2018, expected to result in a data on-net share of 55-60%. The Norwegian operation will also continue investigating and launching disrupting and customer-centric product offerings such as data rollover and rollover sharing, both of which ice was the first to introduce in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, the company will continue its expansion in the machine-to-machine market, following the successful frequency auction win in February 2018. Further investments will also be made into the growing IoT segment, as the 450 MHz band’s unique coverage and indoor penetration characteristics position ice group as a leading IoT challenger through the lifetime of the license. Operations and cash flows The Group’s operating profit amounted to NOK -844,569 (-568,704) thousands. The main changes from previous year in the operations are the costs related to the technology upgrade and related anti-churn activities. The items making the difference between operating profit and operating cash flows of NOK -472,716 (-297,431) thousands consists of depreciation and amortization, interest payments and changes in net working capital. See also note 27 Non-cash items. Investments (CAPEX) The Group’s acquisitions of intangible assets during the year amounted to NOK -175,027 (-145,210) thousands. Investments in tangible assets during the year amounted to NOK -411,585 (-338,130) thousands. The investments are mainly related to the network smartphone migration project in Norway, both on existing and new sites as well as on backbone systems and acquisition of B2C customer base from Hello. Net financial investments for the full year amounted to NOK 3,084 (-3,858) thousands. Financing The Group is financed through owners’ capital and loans. In 2017 the Group has received share capital contributions of NOK 1,030 million from its Parent Company. As per the end of 2017, the Group's total assets amounted to NOK 3,320,368 (2,858,350) thousands of which equity amounted to NOK 523,198 (596,094) thousands which gives an equity/assets ratio of 16% (21%). Strengthening the financial position and reducing annual financial costs was a key priority in 2017. The Company completed a refinancing in March, consisting of NOK 1.4 billion secured bank facilities underwritten by DNB Bank ASA and NOK 800 million senior unsecured bond (ISIN NO 001 0789035). The proceeds of the refinancing were used to part-finance the full redemption of the SEK 1.5 billion high

We also launched Össur Partnership Services to support and strengthen O&P workshops in the U.S. This year and in the future, we will continue to push for greater innovation and better outcomes for our customers. Our global team recognizes many opportunities for learning and enhancement ahead of us—which inspires us to further improve outcomes for our customers. Continuing Growth We continued to focus investment on growth opportunities, as well as returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Sales growth in 2014 was 18%, 5% organic, and we had record sales of USD 509 million. Prosthetics sales growth was excellent across all our major markets and product lines, and sales in bracing and supports grew in line with our expectations. We strengthened our sales channel in Asia-Pacific through two strategic acquisitions and all recent investments have been in line with our plans. The bracing and supports strategy is to increase market share through clear segmentation, and focus on specific indications that are treated with Össur’s premium offer. Therefore, we have divided our bracing and supports range into two segments, creating a dual emphasis on Osteoarthritis Solutions and Injury Solutions. The prevalence of Osteoarthritis continues to rise and the OA brace Unloader One is one of Össur’s most successful products year-todate. For Injury Solutions products, the main objective is to stabilize joints while people recover from fractures and ligament injuries Jón Sigurðsson Össur President and CEO We started 2014 with a bang, introducing the RHEO KNEE® 3, the third generation of Össur’s first-ever bionic product. 2ANNUAL REPORT 14 or to provide post-operative treatment. The Injury Solutions market  prov ides  a  g rea t opportunity for growth. Focus on Efficiency Our continued emphasis on increasing profitabil i ty by focusing on high-end innovative products is yielding promising results. Operationally, we had an excellent year with strong profits and cash flow. The EBITDA grew 38% and was USD 104 million for the year. We have been focused on strengthening our competitive advantage through operational excellence, by optimizing business processes and rationalizing our product portfolio. We have successfully reduced costs, simplified and improved our operating model. Improving Mobility This was a particularly successful year for Össur’s Mobility Clinics—interactive workshops that teach amputees proper running technique on their prosthesis. In the U.S., there were six clinics where about 250 athletes participated. The Össur Mobility Clinic in Boston attracted over 50 amputees and was covered by the Boston Tribune and other acclaimed media outlets. In France, about 130 people joined the Breizh Runner clinic organized by our customer, Orthofiga, in Bretagne. At these clinics, Össur was delighted to help many participants run for the first time since their amputation. Looking forward to 2015 and beyond We are grateful and proud that our work in 2014 enhanced the lives of so many people. We believe that Össur is in a good position for future growth, with the right business model, strategies, and corporate culture. It is our privilege to continue to create life-changing technology that results in better functional, clinical, and health-economic outcomes. Our success is driven by our desire to achieve our mission of improving people’s mobility day after day. We look forward to continuing this rewarding work in 2015 and beyond.

As we move into a new phase of maturity, our focus will be on hedging the revenue line and expanding our operations. Senior management is actively considering opportunities in ground services, engineering, sales distribution and road freight capability. Abu Dhabi The growth of Etihad increased traffic to Abu Dhabi, while Abu Dhabi’s development generated more demand for Etihad’s services. Our fortunes are complementary. In July 2010, His Highness General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, spent several hours visiting our head office to review its operations and meet its staff. He endorsed Etihad’s role as a key economic driver for Abu Dhabi and reviewed the progress of 85 Emirati women who were undergoing training before joining the airline’s new Al Ain call centre. I would like to thank the Government of Abu Dhabi for its unswerving support. I thank the members of our Board, led by our Chairman, His Highness Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for their guidance and oversight. And I thank our partners and suppliers in Abu Dhabi who, each day, work with us to fulfill the Government’s vision for the Emirate. The Etihad team Finally, I thank each and every one of our 8,000 employees for their dedication. Their unmatched skill and diligence is critical to achieving our mandate. James Hogan Etihad has completed another watershed year, marked by growth and success, and adversity in its fair measure. Delivering our mandate With an explicit mandate from our shareholder, the Government of Abu Dhabi, we spent 2010 focused on: consistently delivering the world’s best product and  • service; unlocking scale and efficiency to reach our financial  • targets; and supporting the growth of Abu Dhabi.• I am pleased to report that we are tracking well towards all of our targets. Aviation environment The global aviation industry is recovering from its 2009 malaise, albeit at a conservative pace. Demand in the first quarter of 2010 was particularly soft, as the global economy found its feet. In April, the volcanic ash-related airspace closures across Europe caused passengers significant disruption and the industry material losses. The industry was also affected by Europe’s continuing sovereign debt crises, and related labour unrest. Notwithstanding Europe’s underlying weakness, stronger than expected global GDP growth made for a pleasing second-half performance, with passenger demand rebounding markedly in the northern summer season. Etihad performance Despite isolated areas of weakness, Etihad’s network was naturally hedged by the geographic location of its hub. Europe was a challenging market. Nevertheless,  • these routes were fed by the Subcontinental and Asian side of the network, and load factors and yields are improving. Our North American services performed well, again  • supported by our Indian Subcontinent flying and a weak US dollar. Our routes in North Africa – Casablanca and  • Khartoum – have been standouts and we look to a bright future for our growing network in that part of the world. Our services in Asia benefited from our developing  • African network, with major Chinese, Korean and Japanese investment in Africa generating passenger demand in both directions. Our flights to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and  • the Philippines are all operating at full capacity, predominantly with point-to-point UAE traffic. We are well placed as a hub, and to support point- • to-point UAE traffic, to our destinations in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) – Almaty, Astana, Minsk and Moscow. Like Europe, these routes continue to mature and improve. Our partnership with Virgin Blue in Australia  • has already paid early dividends in the corporate segment, providing passenger flows onto our Europe and Middle East networks. Outlook Cargo demand and yields – lead measures of industry trends – have recovered robustly. Passenger yields are also on the rise and close to pre-2008 levels. Yet while many indicators are positive, our industry does face risks in the immediate future. The introduction of a new EU environmental taxation regime, with the possibility of separate national tax measures remaining in place, means Europe risks becoming uncompetitive. The inflated price of commodities, specifically oil, is forcing structural increases to our operating costs. And moving into the New Year, greater capacity in the market has put pressure on our yields and passenger loads. As we grow and meet the tremendous cost of aircraft purchases and leasing, many of our larger competitors are returning capacity to their networks through increased utilisation, deploying aircraft they had mothballed during the global financial crisis. Supporting this view, the International Air Transport Association recently concluded that the 80 per cent rise in global industry year-on-year profits in 2010 was achieved with a corresponding 1.2 per cent rise in revenues. Civil unrest across the Middle East and North Africa has also impacted our operational performance in the first quarter of 2011. Nevertheless, our contingency plans have proven robust and our employees in the region have responded magnificently. Future plans The airline’s near-term focus is on breaking even in 2011 and moving into sustainable profitability in the following year.

All users of bone anchored hearing systems benefit from a sound processor with the highest possible maximum output. As the most powerful abutment-level sound processor in the market, Ponto 3 SuperPower provides premium sound quality and a unique option for the majority of users of bone anchored hearing systems. “The Ponto has increased my capabilities, my gifts and passions” Camilla Gilbert was born with a hearing loss. She is a BAHS user and has witnessed the benefits of Oticon Medical’s Ponto first-hand. Listen to her story. About the front cover Bone anchored hearing systems (BAHS) like Ponto are designed to use your body’s natural ability to transfer sound through bone conduction. The implanted part is discreetly placed through the skin on the scull bone and lets you snap on the sound processor. The powerful sound processor is worn behind the ear and converts sound into vibrations, which are then sent through the skull bone directly to your inner ear.
