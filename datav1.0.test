Operating profit per kilo continued to improve, from SEK 0.59 to SEK 0.60 due to a higher proportion of value added products.  A record high operating profit for the first quarter for the largest business area, Food Ingredients, reached SEK 137 million (104), an increase of 32 percent. In the first quarter the business area reported significant volume growth of 12 percent. Continued increases in volumes of high-value products and a consequently more profitable product mix enhanced the result. The integration of the acquired Golden Foods/Golden Brands (now AAK Louisville) continue to develop according to plan.  The business area Chocolate & Confectionery Fats’ operating result reached SEK 81 million (81) and remained stable as earlier predicted.  The smallest business area, Technical Products & Feed continued to experience challenging markets conditions. The underlying trend in the first quarter 2012 was still very challenging but slightly less challenging than during the third and fourth quarter 2011.  We also recorded, as predicted, a record high first quarter cash flow of SEK 384 million.  Earnings per share increased, from SEK 3.38 to SEK 3.43 despite higher interest costs. Concluding remarks: “The impact on our industry from the more difficult general economy in Europe is difficult to predict. However, based on AAK’s customer value propositions for health and reduced costs, customer product co-development and solutions approach, and the AAK Acceleration program (Growth-Efficiency-People), we remain prudently optimistic for the future mainly driven by a very strong Food Ingredients business,” says CEO and President Arne Frank.AarhusKarlshamn AB Phone +46 40 627 8300 info@aak.com 556669-2850 Jungmansgatgan 12 Fax +46 40 627 83 11 www.aak.com SE5566692850001 SE-211 19 Malmö Registered office: Malmö SWEDEN The Interim report for the first quarter 2012 will be presented today, 3 May 2012 at 1 pm CET at a telephone conference.

In Stockholm, DHL leases a terminal on the Drivremmen 1 property from Catena. Today, the terminal, which Catena acquired from DHL in late 2016, is a state of the art facility. The project managers for DHL are Björn Rönning and Sara Dawidson. Both work within the DHL’s property staff unit that safeguards optimal functionality at all of the company’s logistics facilities. Sara Dawidson explains: “Drivremmen 1 is a terminal specialised in reloading and distributing all types of goods, except frozen and refrigerated ones. We receive goods 24 hours a day, six days a week at the terminal. These are goods on pallets that, kept whole or broken down into smaller packages, are reloaded onto smaller vehicles that can more easily navigate Stockholm’s narrow city-centre streets, or that are forwarded to other DHL facilities. This imposes a number of demands on a modern terminal.” Location that minimises transport “The location must allow all addresses in the area served by the terminal to be reached with the shortest possible transport distances. It should also be adjacent to a trunk road junction, allowing the terminal to be accessed easily by the larger trailers arriving from the entire Nordic region around the clock. It should be located in an area without housing, so that operation can continue around the clock without disturbing the neighbours’ sleep. Drivremmen’s location at one of Stockholm’s entry points meets these criteria well.” Designed for efficient goods handling “Another key requirement is the facility’s design, based on several large vehicles carrying arriving goods being able to offload at the same time. This demands space and a large number of loading bays. Equally important is the terminal’s capacity for smaller vehicles, including delivery vans. They should easily be able to load the goods to be delivered to stores or directly to consumers. In addition, a modern terminal must be designed to facilitate marshalling and reloading of the goods being handled while minimising internal transport. DHL applies well-proven models for optimal goods handling, meaning that the Drivremmen terminal meets DHL’s stringent requirements on logistics efficiency.” Energy efficiency that spares the environment and cuts costs “We also have a clear responsibility for sustainability within DHL,” Sara Dawidson continues. “That imposes considerable demands, both on the facilities we operate ourselves and the ones we lease. Drivremmen meets these requirements well. DHL has itself made major investments in the facility to save energy. The facility is heated with a geothermal heating system and has additional insulation to minimize heat losses. The ventilation has been improved and all lighting has been replaced with modern LED technology. That has improved not only the facility’s environmental efficiency, but also its cost-efficiency.” Improvement continues Catena’s Tobias Karlsson, who manages the property, sums up the situation: “At Drivremmen, we have developed a modern and, in all respects, efficient facility at a strategically important address in Västberga, on the outskirts of Stockholm. This development was initiated by DHL but continued by Catena following its acquisition of the property. Today, the terminal of just over 33,000 square metres, which was built as a Green Building facility, is fully leased to DHL. We are now continuing to improve the property. The agenda includes replacing switches to correctly and safely safeguard power supply and reduce power consumption. New lifts were installed too, also contributing to comfort on the property. The upgrading of the dining room and changing rooms also contributes, perhaps to an even greater extent,” concludes Tobias Karlsson. Energy efficient premises for DHL’s city logistics 2 INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2018 CATENA ABStrong earnings with continued prioritisation of project development Profit from property management has risen by 25 percent and our project portfolio has never been larger. Catena has both the capacity and the expertise to continue strengthening our position through further investments. In accordance with our intentions, we have increased our rental income compared with the second quarter of 2017, largely due to acquisitions and increased net letting. Regardless of whether new production or acquired properties are involved, the objective is to always be present in the country’s most important logistics locations. We also offer properties that in earnest match the needs that are appearing as consumption patterns and goods flows shift. This has, for example, resulted in an advanced position in digitally driven trade and our having positioned ourselves early in city logistics where more frequent retail deliveries and food deliveries to consumers and restaurants are imposing new demands on sustainable logistics and infrastructure in urban areas. Profit from property management, which basically represents our cash flow before changes in working capital, amounted to 52 percent of our rental income – an outcome that is entirely in line with our stated ambitions for the period. Continued project development During the first quarter, the Mappen 1 property in Linköping was acquired, adjacent to our existing facilities in the area, where new construction is also in progress. On the whole, this provides economies of scale and we see great potential for a major FMCG cluster in Linköping. Outside Malmö, an agreement was signed with DS Smith and Lekia regarding our fourth facility in the Sunnanå logistics location. The facility at Sunnanå is a multi-tenant warehouse of more than 36,000 square metres in two buildings, adapted to accommo- date more tenants, some of whom will have premises needs that vary over time. We are also investing SEK 107 million in Tahe 1:64, an existing logistics property in Jönköping, after signing a new lease contract with Procurator. Large parts of the property are being remodelled and extended. Completed, the property will have 41,800 square metres of space, most of which has already been leased. Our ambition is to develop additional facilities on an ongoing basis and we have a number of projects that are ready for tenants to move into during the year. Catena has never had such a large project portfolio (SEK 1,337 million) as it does now – and our remaining investment volume in new and existing buildings exceeds SEK 760 million. In particular, the portfolio is growing in digital commerce, city logistics and food distribution, providing confirmation that we are able to meet the new needs that are emerging, attracting industries and businesses with a high rate of change and strong growth. Expertise and capacity for continued growth Good market awareness and new trade patterns are important success factors. For our continued expansion, we also have access to more than 1,700,000 square metres of developable land in strategic locations, and our balance sheet is being further strengthened by ongoing cash flows driven by stable surplus levels and cost-efficient financing. During the quarter, a commercial paper programme was established. This has a framework amount of SEK 2 billion and we have issued commercial papers for SEK 750 million, with maturities of four to nine months and an average interest rate of an attractive 0.39 percent. The programme is covered through backup facilities via property mortgages. Logistics takes its place among respected investments We can now state that logistics properties have become an attractive investment in which there is considerable interest, reflected not least in the trend in Catena’s share price. We receive repeated invitations from the international capital market, and the potential in Sweden is considered particularly high with digitally driven trade not yet having reached its full impact. It is gratifying to see how opportunities in new logistics solutions are being highlighted and play a prominent role. We have worked hard for this over many years, not least through our own inspiration day, Logistics Trends, which attracted a full house in May when arranged for the eighth time. Our knowledge and dedication are paying off. Ultimately, it is the efforts of Catena’s employees that enable us to deliv- er attractive solutions, continuously sharpen our offering and continue to strengthen our position as the leading in logistics property company. Helsingborg, July 2018 Benny Thögersen, CEO 3INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2018 CATENA ABIncome and profit Rental income Rental income in the period increased by 22 percent to SEK 527.5 million (433.6). The increase is mainly due to the acquisition and completion of major projects. Income from contracts with terms of more than three years accounted for approximately 72 percent of Catena’s contractual annual rent, which entails stable income with no appreciable variation between periods, except in connection with acquisitions, completed projects and sales. The average remaining lease period is approximately five years. Duration of leases Duration No. of contracts Contractual annual rent, SEK M Contractual annual rent, % 2018 83 10.5 1 2019 138 174.8 16 2020 77 114.4 11 2021 42 189.5 18 2022 22 88.4 8 2023 23 119.7 11 2024+ 52 380.6 35 Total 437 1,077.9 100 Property expenses Property expenses increased to SEK 130.9 million (103.3) due to a larger property portfolio but also due to increased maintenance of the properties. The cold winter with an unusually high amount of snow also increased costs. There are seasonal variations in the operation and mainte- nance of properties. Winters with much cold and snow entail higher costs for heating and snow removal. A hot summer can mean increased expenses for cooling. These variations, which have the greatest impact during the winter and summer months, are, to some extent, offset by a change in billed expenses to tenants. Financial expenses Financial expenses amounted to SEK 120.1 million in the first half of the year (103.1). The increase in financial expenses is due in part to a larger property portfolio, but is mainly the result of the reorganisation of swaps carried out in the first quarter of 2017, which, in turn, affected financing expenses positively by SEK 16.6 million as a non-recurring effect. The fact that the financial expenses, cleared for the previous year’s reorganisation of swaps, and despite a larger loan volume, remain on the same level as in 2017 demonstrates that Catena’s efforts to lower its interest level have yielded results. Compared with the second quarter of 2017, Catena has lowered its aver- age interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 2.8 percent (3.3). Profit Despite the higher financial expenses, profit from property management increased by 25 percent compared with the previous period, from SEK 54.9 million to SEK 274.2 million. The primary reason for the improved profit from property management is an increased portfolio. The share in the earn- ings of associated companies is significantly higher than in the previous period, mainly due to a value adjustment of the Huddinge Regulatorn 2 property. Profit for the period amounted to SEK 371.2 million, which is SEK 35.0 million higher than in the preceding year. Changes in value of property and goodwill are SEK 33.0 million lower than in the corresponding period in the preceding year, while the change in value of derivatives is SEK 12.2 million lower than in the preceding year. The unrealised changes in value are of an accounting nature and do not affect cash flow. On 14 June, the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) adopted new tax regulations for the business sector. Among other things, the decision entails a two-step reduction in corporation tax to 21.4 percent as of 2019, and to 20.6 percent as of 2021. As a conse- quence of this decision, Catena has made a preliminary revalu- ation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, entailing a non- recurring tax income item of approximately SEK 67 million.

third quarter 2017 Back to business – and strong growth For the first time in quite some time, we could focus entirely on our customers and our business during this quarter. We had no big distractions, like the warehouse move or the IPO in this quarter. You could also say, that there were no excuses. Therefore, we are very pleased that we managed to accelerate the business again during the quarter. Our Group net revenue was SEK 454.9 million, corresponding to a growth of 45.7% compared to the third quarter last year. Boozt.com grew with solid 52.8%, with net revenues amounting to SEK 440.6 million. We are especially pleased that the investments in our new fulfilment centre have started to pay off. We crossed “the magic line” in the fulfilment centre during the second half of the quarter, as the fulfilment cost per order (including depreciations and rent), went below last year. This, combined with economies of scale in distribution resulted in a fulfilment cost ratio (that includes distribution costs) that was lower than in the third quarter last year. In addition to the above, we managed to lower the marketing cost ratio from 18.5% to 13.3%. We see this as a strong sign that our brand is getting stronger, and as a proof of our ability to attract new customers at the same time as our existing customers buy from us more frequently. This is explicitly expressed in the True Frequency that increased from 5.3 to 6.5 in the quarter. Our Trustpilot score remained at a 5-star rating and an all-time-high of 9.1 and our NPS score continued at the same high level as in the preceding period. We are well positioned in the market. Our curated focus on mainly Nordic brands offering affordable luxury to the Nordic consumer is starting to pay off.

CEO COMMENTS Troax has developed well during the second quarter with an organic increase in orders of 17%, which clearly is above the historical growth average. We have received several important orders from customers within, automotive, warehouse and property, which shows that the Troax offering is strong. The newly acquired company in the USA, Folding Guard is following their plans and has a favorable trend in orders received. Our judgment is that the market development during the second Quarter has been positive for the Group. The growth has been especially strong in Continental Europe, and also new Markets have had a positive quarter. In the UK, we have during the second quarter seen some negative effects of a weaker willingness to invest at some customer groups, probably caused by the uncertainty related to Brexit etc. The orderbook at the end of the quarter continues on a good level. The integration work of the acquired company (end of last year), Folding Guard is progressing well. During the second quarter, the Nashville warehouse has been closed and the distribution moved to Chicago. The focus on growth continues to be strong but is not expected to show any bigger impacts until 2018/19. We can again confirm that the acquisition has so far been well received by important customers in the US. We see good opportunities to strengthen the customer base, long term, for both brands in the important market of North America. Sales invoiced increased in the quarter by 40 per cent compared with the same period last year (excluding acquisition and currency the increase is 26 per cent). The progress was positive in all markets. Totally, the Group has increased to an order intake level of approximately 138 MEUR on a rolling 12 month basis (including Folding Guard for the first two quarters of 2017). The result has continued to improve during the quarter, mainly because of good sales volumes and the consequential good capacity utilization in our factories. During last year, we also had some one-time costs related to the inauguration of the new paint line which we do not have this year. The market investments are continuing per plan. This is at a lower level short term, as some internal resources have been dedicated to the integration of our American acquisition. The operating result was 8,2 (5,1) MEUR, which corresponds to a profit margin of 20,7 per cent to be compared with 18,0 per cent last year. It should be noted that the consolidation of Folding Guard decreases the margin in percentage terms. We do however see clear possibilities to increase the margin also for Folding Guard long term. The Net result has also developed in a positive way, and amounts to 3,7 MEUR for the quarter (3,1 MEUR). In this comparison, we must consider that we have had a one-time financing cost of -2,3 MEUR related to the redemption of the bond in order to move over to ordinary bank financing. Barring any other eventualities, this change in the company’s financing structure will improve the finance net by 3,4 MEUR annually from now onwards. The result per share after the first half year is 0,39 EUR to be compared with 0,30 EUR last year. The Working Capital is on a similar level as the previous quarter. Work in Progress is on a continued high level, indicating that some important projects still are under implementation and hence still have not been invoiced. We have continued with good cash generation from operations during the quarter and the net debt is now 66,5 MEUR and the key figure of our interest-bearing loan in comparison with EBITDA is below our target for the Group.

1	81Boozt AB / Annual Report 2017 This is the Group’s report on non-financial (environmental, social and governance- related) information. The report has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Report Act's Sustainability Reporting Requirements. The Group defines sustainability in this context as the work on environmental issues, anti-corruption and bribery, employee and social matters, and human rights. For Boozt to work with sustainability means to positively contribute to society while minimizing any negative impact from the Group’s own operations. It also includes communicating the Group’s own expectations to fashion and cosmetics brands, whose products the Group sells on its sites, and the work done to ensure that brands and partners comply with applicable regulations and expectations from customers. Boozt’s priorities are related to risk management as well as seizing business opportunities. The risks that the Group considers to be of material importance are included in the Group’s risk report on page 76. Specific risks assessed to prioritize sustainability issues, are identified and commented on below. Sustainability report Director's report82 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2017 Reporting requirement Comments Boozt’s business model consists of purchasing clothes, accessories and cosmetics from established brands and promoting and selling them to the wider public through its online and offline shops. Boozt is a main player in the mid- to premium segment in the Nordics and adds value through matching supply and demand in an innovative and consumer-friendly way. As an online retailer, with no own production of garments, accessories, or cosmetics, many of the sustainability risks the Group’s business faces are indirect and related to parts of the supply chain. While the Group has no immediate control over supply chain sustainability risks, it can take measures to assess suppliers’ performance and minimize risks. Identified direct risks are mainly associated with the Group’s operations in the fulfilment centre and as an employer. Through an analysis of its operations, the Group has identified four main risks related to sustainability: Occupational health and safety, Product quality risks, Environmental impacts of transportation and Corruption. Risks related to working environment have been assessed and are managed through a systematic approach to occupational health and safety. Risk include physical risks, mainly in the handling of products and product returns in the fulfillment center, but also psychosocial risks, such as stress, in all parts of our business. All managers are made aware of their responsibility of preventing these risks. Fire safety is of highest priority, specifically in the fulfilment centre with respect to contingency planning. With modern techniques the Group has been able to implement comprehensive preventive safeguards to keep the risk of fires at an absolute minimum. In the automated retrieval system there’s no oxygen, which decreases the risk of fires among the inventory goods kept in the system. All flammable goods, such as perfumes, are kept in a fireproof safety room designed with purpose to prevent potential fires to spread. Fire prevention is managed in a systematic way, with documented continuous safety rounds being performed. Business model Identified risks and risk management Director's report83Boozt AB / Annual Report 2017 The Group also identified product quality risks related to hazardous substances in products distributed by our brand partners posing a risk to the environment and human health, or not meeting ethical requirements of our customers. This risk is primarily managed through contractual agreements and requirements on the brand partners. Animal welfare is really important for Boozt, and we are aware of the challenges the fashion sectors faces with regard to animal welfare and the ethical issues surrounding the well-being and treatment of animals. We have hence decided not to trade fur products and have been a fur-free retailer since 2016. Swedish and Danish animal rights organisations, Djurens Rätt and Anima list Boozt as a fur-free retailer. A default risk associated to the e-commerce business model, and perhaps one of the biggest challenges the Group as well as other players in the market are facing from a sustainability perspective, is the challenge of addressing the environmental impact of transportation of goods. Boozt is humble to this challenge and we try to address the issues from different perspectives. As one of the biggest e-commerce players in the Nordic market, we are an important partner for the logistic transporters. As a consequence we have an indirect possibility to impact our partners by encouraging and offering to be part of initiatives to decrease CO2 emissions, which we do while negotiating and developing services with our partners. Another perspective is the possibilities that comes with scale with respect to optimize filling capacity in the cars, which means that the trucks drive shorter distances. To limit this risk, the Group’s operations work closely with transport partners to optimize internal and external flows in the supply chain, in order to minimize CO2 emissions and other local impacts. There is an inherent risk that individuals, in our own operations or in the interaction with us, breach legal requirements and our ethical principles, related to anti-corruption and business ethics. We have risks related to the fact that we are now a listed company, and must prevent any sensitive information to be shared and used wrongfully. We also have risks related to our purchasing of goods from many different brands. We have policies and procedures in place adressing these risks in a systematic way. Director's report Identified risks and risk management84 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2017 Environment Policies Due-diligence procedures Results Indicators Director's report The Group has adopted a Group Policy regarding Environmental impact which sets the basic foundation for the Group’s decision-making and procedures. The main focus of the policy is the Group’s own operations, in particular the fulfilment centre. The operations in the fulfilment centre are driven by energy efficient and modern technology which are supported by 100% renewable energy-sources, currently energy from hydropower, but with ongoing activities to partly replace external energy sources with self-produced solar energy from solar panels on the roof of the fulfilment centre. Thereby dependency on external energy will decrease, strengthening the Group’s contingency planning in the case of a power/electricity outage. Our logistic and fulfilment centre in Ängelholm, which is the largest building, with the highest energy consumption within our operations is a GreenBuilding certified facility. The certification requires that the energy consumption of the building is 25% lower than required in the regulations set by the Swedish National Board of Housing, which has been successfully managed since the fulfilment centre was taken into use. The target for energy consumption in the fulfilment centre has been set to maintain compliance with the GreenBuilding requirements. During 2017 the Group has enacted measures to minimize the environmental impact of the packaging material used to distribute products to consumers. During 2017 the composition of the material used in the plastic bags was improved, from being 50% recyclable to 80% recyclable. Plastic bags are the preferred packaging solutions as they are significantly smaller and lighter than cardboard packaging, thus resulting in less waste and less transportation weight. Plastic bags were in 2017 approximately 80% of all outbound packaging material and the Group has set a target to introduce bags constituted of 100% decomposable material during 2018. With respect to recycling of waste, the recycling process of all packaging material from inbound deliveries has been significantly improved due to the investments made in efficient recycling systems in the warehouse. More than 82% of all waste has been recycled since the new fulfilment centre opened. Recycled materials consist mainly of paper, wood and plastic. We aim to improve this ratio; the target ratio is set at 85% for 2018.
116	Cybercom Group AB (publ) Box 7574, SE-103 93 Stockholm, Sweden Tel +46 8 578 646 00 To the editor 28 March 2017 Cybercom reveals bias using a social experiment Cybercom has developed True Colors, an app intended to demonstrate that external attributes influence how people perceive each other. Cybercom wanted to use a filmed social experiment to highlight the problem of unintentional bias and the importance of diversity in the IT industry. There are many different factors behind the low proportion of women in the IT sector. Cybercom wanted to use a filmed experiment to reveal that unintentional bias is one of these, and it developed an augmented reality (AR) app called True Colors for the test. “We strive to create a workplace for everyone at Cybercom. Diversity, whether in terms of gender, age, ethnicity or religion, is hugely important to us, and is critical to the continued development of our business. But we also understand that there are a number of challenging factors for the IT industry to overcome in order to achieve real diversity. One of these is unintentional bias, which is why we have chosen to highlight the problem using an experiment,” says Niklas Flyborg, Cybercom’s CEO. Once the user inserts their smartphone into the headset and targets the camera at another person, that person’s voice becomes distorted and their image is anonymised into a colourful chameleon. The app makes it impossible to identify or unconsciously judge a person based on how they appear or sound. During the experiment four test subjects were asked to wear the headset. They were then positioned in front of four other people with different professions and interests, who talked about their backgrounds. At the next stage, the test subjects were asked to remove the headset and look at the people they had been listening to, before trying to pair each story with the right individual. Their guesses were mostly wrong, and the people were paired according to a more stereotypical image of their professions and interests. “We wanted to use True Colors and the experiment to show that anyone can judge people from the wrong preconceptions, without even being aware of it. Along with many of our industry colleagues, we are making active efforts to use various ways to highlight and change the factors that make diversity in the sector so low, particularly the proportion of women. There are many explanations, of course, not least that we need to make IT and technology more attractive to women as well as counteract prejudice and smash the glass ceiling. We hope this experiment will help to make us all think a little more,” says Kristina Cato, Head of Communications at Cybercom.Cybercom Group AB (publ) Box 7574, SE-103 93 Stockholm, Sweden Tel +46 8 578 646 00 Watch the experiment here: https://youtu.be/cz_C5Wiweg0 About Cybercom’s diversity efforts:  In 2015, the AllBright foundation recognised Cybercom as the best in the technology industry in terms of the proportion of women in leadership roles, with 36 % women in the executive team. Cybercom is working actively to attract more women to the company by participating in various training opportunities and events, most recently by sponsoring Women in Tech.  At the end of 2016, the proportion of women employed by Cybercom was 18 %, but with a target to achieve at least as many female employees as the proportion of women graduating from the technical universities, i.e. at least 30 % in the long term.  In order to engage girls and boys in the industry at an earlier age, Cybercom regularly invites parents and their children to learn to code and to be inspired to gain an interest and curiosity in IT and technology. Cybercom is also a principal partner to Hello World, which organises camps and meetups for children and young people throughout Sweden to be digitally creative during their weekends and school holidays.  Cybercom has a large proportion of employees from international backgrounds, and participates in initiatives such as Talents without Boarders, Good Malmö and LinkedIn’s Welcome Talent to further boost these numbers. Former UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon visited Cybercom in Stockholm following our work with labour migration.

26	Organic growth of 44% (constant currency 40%) in the second quarter with 43% growth in Boozt.com and 90% growth in Booztlet.com. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 2.7 percentage points to 4.9%. For the first six months organic growth was 38% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 1.5 percentage points to 2.4%. The revenue growth outlook for 2018 is adjusted upwards to more than 36% from previously more than 33%. CEO Hermann Haraldsson says: “As communicated after Q1 we had solid momentum in the first part of Q2, which we maintained throughout the quarter resulting in a growth of 44%. As always, our focus is on giving the best possible customer experience to increase the loyalty with our customers. The positive development in the key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction and true frequency shows that the building blocks for continued growth are in place.” “Profitability showed a good development as the operational cost ratios improved showing the value of our flexible and scalable setup in both fulfilment, marketing and administration. The positive development on the operational side was partly offset by a lower gross margin. Trading conditions turned a bit more difficult towards the end of the quarter due to the unusual long and warm summer in the Nordics. As we are allergic to building up too much inventory in season we increased the promotional activity towards the end of Q2, putting pressure on the gross margin. This has continued into Q3.“ “Based on our solid performance in the first six months and momentum in the key performance indicators we feel confident in increasing our growth guidance to more than 36% for the year. We look forward to a busy rest of the year with increased focus on the categories Beauty, Sports and Kids coupled with exciting brand launches such as adidas, Reebok and Polarn O. Pyret.

Rolling 12 months Apr 1 - Jun 30, 2018 Apr 1 - Jun 30, 2017 ChangeChange3Boozt AB (publ) / Half year report 2018 Net revenue Net revenue in Q2 increased with 44.0% to SEK 714.7 million (496.1). Currency had a positive impact of around 4 percentage points on net revenue growth and relates primarily to the strengthening of DKK, EUR and NOK compared to SEK. The net revenue increase was driven by 42.8% growth for Boozt.com and 89.8% growth for Booztlet.com. The structural growth towards online continued in the Nordics, and while the beginning of the quarter was positive impacted by the sudden change of weather, the long summer began to have a negative impact on the customer activity towards the end of the period, leading to more promotional activity to drive traffic and clear seasonal inventory. Other net revenue increased to SEK 7.0 million (4.4) in the second quarter driven by marketing income and realised revenue from breakage of gift cards. For the first 6 months net revenue increased with 38.1% to SEK 1,266.6 million (917.3). Currency had a positive impact of around 4 percentage points on net revenue growth and relates primarily to the strengthening of DKK, EUR and NOK compared to SEK. Other net revenue increased to SEK 18.0 million (9.0) in the first six months driven by marketing income and realised revenue from breakage of gift cards. Breakage from gift cards has been re-estimated since January 1 2018. Breakage is classified as net revenue as a consequence of implementing IFRS 15, (see note 1 for reconciliation to previous disclosed income statement and financial position). In the first quarter of 2017, a net revenue of SEK 10.8 million from the Group’s commission sales agreement with ECCO was included in the segment Other, which impacts negatively the net revenue development of the segment Other for the first half of 2018 compared to the same period last year. Net revenue - geographical split Net revenue growth in Sweden was 38.4% in the quarter, while the increase in rest of Nordic was 44.8%. The increase in Rest of Europe of 87.6% was driven by an increasing consumer appetite towards Nordic fashion brands, despite no change in marketing strategy outside the Nordics. For the first 6 months net revenue growth in Sweden was 35.6%, while the increase in rest of Nordics was 41.4%. Rest of Europe increased 20.8% and was negatively impacted by the termination of the ECCO mono brand shop for Europe that the Group facilitated up until the first quarter of 2017.

Half year report - January 1 - June 30 2018 Group development Jan 1 - Jun 30, 2018 Jan 1 - Jun 30, 2017 Change Net revenue - geographical split Rounding differences may affect the summations.4 Boozt AB (publ) / Half year report 2018 For the first six months EBIT increased to SEK 27.7 million (-109.1), while the EBIT margin increased 14.1% percentage points to 2.2% (-11.9%). The increase is mainly attributable to one-off costs related to the IPO in Q2 2017, but also driven by improvements in all the operational cost ratios due to scale and efficiency effects partly offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 35.0 million (10.9) in the second quarter. The adjustment is related to change in the reserve for social charges related to the Group’s warrant program of SEK -0.5 million. The size of the reserve fluctuates between periods since it, among other things, is affected by the share price of the company and the probability of number of vested warrants. The adjustment also includes cost for share-based payments related to the warrant program of SEK -0.3 million. The adjusted EBIT margin increased with 2.7 percentage points to 4.9% (2.2%). The improvement is due to an improvement in the adjusted operating cost ratios partly offset by lower gross margin. The adjusted fulfilment cost ratio decreased with 1.8 percentage points from 15.2% to 13.4% due to improved productivity and the economies of scale achieved through the investments made in the group’s fulfilment centre during 2017. The adjusted admin & other cost ratio decreased with 2.4 percentage point in the period to 9.5% (12.0%). The decrease is driven by positive scale effects from better terms with suppliers as well as a relatively slower increase in staff costs. For the first six months adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 30.8 million (8.3). Adjustments of SEK -2.0 million related to change in the reserve for social charges related to the Group’s warrant program and SEK -1.1 million for share-based payments related to the warrant program were made. The adjusted EBIT margin increased with Gross profit The gross profit increased with 36.5% to SEK 300.4 million (220.1) during the quarter. The gross margin decreased to 42.0% (44.4%). The decrease in gross margin is mainly driven by an early start to the sales season compared to a later start last year and increased promotional activity to drive traffic in June, where the very warm weather tempered consumer spending. For the first six months gross profit increased with 26.8% to SEK 516.4 million (407.2). The gross margin decreased to 40.8% (44.4%). The decrease in gross margin can be partly explained by the reasons above but also by the items impacting gross margin in Q1 2018, being delayed spending on full price spring items due to the cold weather, a relative smaller share of campaign goods and the terminated commission sales agreement with ECCO. EBIT EBIT increased to SEK 34.1 million (-82.9) for the quarter, while the EBIT margin increased 21.5 percentage points to 4.8% (-16.7%). The increase is driven by improvements in all the operational cost ratios but primarily the admin & other cost ratio which decreased 20.9 percentage points from 30.5% to 9.6%. The decrease in the admin & other cost ration was primarily driven by Q2 2017 being impacted negatively by one-off costs related to the IPO. The fulfilment cost ratio decreased 2.1 percentage points from 15.5% to 13.4% due to improved productivity and the economies of scale achieved through the investments made in the group’s fulfilment centre during 2017, but also partly due to one-off costs related to the warehouse move in Q2 2017 of SEK 1.6 million. The marketing cost ratio decreased 0.6 percentage point to 12.7% (13.3%). Scale effects in marketing were partly offset by higher spending on new customers, which continue to be a priority as long as they can be acquired at an acceptable price.

26	TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA 2nd Quarter 2000 Results 2nd Quarter 2000 Financial Highlights TGS-NOPEC reports a strong 22% increase in Net Revenues and a 178% increase in Operating Profit compared to Q2 1999. Operating Profit of NOK 65,5 million was 47% of Net Revenues compared to NOK 23,6 million (21% of Net Revenues) in Q2 1999. Gross consolidated Revenues were NOK 150,0 million, up 24% from NOK 120,5 million in Q2 1999, and Net Operating Revenues were NOK 139,0 million, up 22% from NOK 114,2 million in Q2 1999. Second quarter EBITDA from operations of NOK 103,0 million was 74% of Net Revenues, up 38% from the same period last year (NOK 74,8 million). Pretax Profit for the quarter was NOK 63,5 million, 46% of Net Revenues, compared to NOK 20,7 million during Q2 1999. Earnings per Share were NOK 1,70 (NOK 1,62 fully diluted) for Q2 2000 compared to NOK 0,57 in Q2 1999. Revenue Breakdown Net Late Sales of NOK 86,9 million increased 117% from Q2 1999 and accounted for 63% of Net Consolidated Revenues. Early Participant and other project related Revenues totaled NOK 48,7 million, funding 66% of the Company’s investment into the Multi-client Library during the second quarter. Proprietary Contract Revenues amounted to NOK 3,4 million. Operational Costs The high Late Sales resulted in an amortization charge associated with Net Multi-Client revenues as low as 24% of Net Revenues compared to the average rate of 31% for the full year of 1999. The corresponding amortization rate for Q2 1999 was 40%. This rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the sales mix of projects. Out of this quarter’s Late Sales a major portion came from surveys with low or fully amortized Book Value, thus triggering low or no amortization cost. Management expects the amortization rate to increase to stay between 30% and 40% of Net Revenues for 2000. The year-to-date amortization rate is 28% of Net Revenues compared to 30% for the first six months of 1999. Total operational costs payable for the quarter, including materials, were NOK 33,4 million compared to NOK 39,4 million in Q2 1999 primarily as a result of the stacking of the Odin Explorer in Q1 1999. Profit Operating Profit for the quarter was NOK 65,5 million, 47% of Net Revenues, a 178% increase over Q2 1999 (NOK 23,6). The Pre-tax Profit of NOK 63,5 million was 207% higher than the NOK 20,7 million reported in Q2 1999. EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) for the three months ended June 30th , was NOK 103,0 million, 74% of Net Revenues compared to NOK 74,8 (66%) in Q2 1999. Financial Items The rate of exchange between the USD and the NOK changed from 8,47 on March 31 st, 2000 to 8,56 on June 30th. In accordance with NGAAP, a non-cash exchange loss of NOK 1,9 million was recorded in the accounts regarding the USD 21,0 million loan per June 30th . In accordance with the payment schedule contracted with the bank, the Company paid the first installment on the loan on August 11 th of USD 2,1 million. Tax During 1999, the Company earned profits largely in the USA with a 36% tax rate, while the Company’s Norwegian operations suffered a tax loss (tax rate 28%) due to write-downs of vessels. The Company estimates a tax rate for year 2000 of no more than 35%, as the Norwegian legal entity per June 30 th was operating profitably again. Net Income and Earnings per Share (EPS) Net Income for Q2 2000 was NOK 41,3 million, NOK 1,70 per share undiluted, and NOK 1,62 per share fully diluted, 203% higher than reported in Q2 1999; NOK 13,6 mill and EPS NOK 0,57 per share. Business Segments and Investments TGS-NOPEC’s main business is developing, managing, conducting, and selling non-exclusive seismic surveys. This activity accounted for virtually all of the Company’s business during the first 6 months of 2000. Investments inthe data library totaled NOK 74,0 million for the second quarter, 18% lower than in Q2 1999. Total investments in the Multi-Client Library during the first six months of 2000 were NOK 157,5, an increase of 17% compared to NOK 134,2 million for the same period in 1999. The Company expects to ramp up its Multi-Client investments during Q3 2000, commencing its own 3D survey in UK waters in addition to increasing its 3D financial exposure in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company recognized NOK 48,7 million in Early Participant revenues during the quarter. Total pre- funding recognized represents 66% of total investments in Q2 2000. Balance Sheet As of June 30, 2000, the Company’s total cash holdings amounted to NOK 230,5 million, up from NOK 118,2 million on December 31st, 1999. Total interest bearing debt increased from NOK 202,8 million per December 31 st, 1999 to NOK 246,3 per March 31st, 2000 as a result of the opening of a new long-term loan facility in February and drawn overdrafts per June 30th, 2000. The sale of the M/V Odin Explorer was consummated on August 2nd, 2000 at the sales price contracted in December 1999. The vessel is carried in the Balance Sheet per June 30 th, 2000 at sales price.

The majority of this activity was concentrated in Brazil, Newfoundland, the Gulf of Mexico, Faroes/Shetland and Portugal. A total of eight different seismic vessels contributed to this effort. Outlook During the first six months of 2000, the Company has placed major emphasis on securing long-term volume purchase commitments from clients. These commitments will materialize into Late Sales or Pre-funding over the coming 18 to 24 months. Due to the variability of the Company’s equity share in the portfolio of Multi-Client projects that may be purchased with these volume commitments, it is not possible to fully predict their impact on the Profit and Loss Account of TGS-NOPEC. Per June 30 th, Gross Sales Commitments totaled in excess of NOK 250,0 million. Based on the historical records, Management conservatively estimates that between 33% and 50% of this amount will remain with TGS-NOPEC as Net Revenue. The Company plans to increase activity on new surveys and new added value products from the existing library during the third quarter. The Company continues to actively develop a number of 3D projects in several geographic areas. Acquisition of the Company’s first 100% owned 3D Multi-Client survey will commence in August, with data delivery to clients scheduled for December 2000.While the seismic sector continues to strengthen, significant improvements in the market continue to lag the increased activity levels in other oilfield sectors. A number of major and large independent oil companies have publicly announced increased exploration and development spending plans for the remainder of 2000 as well as 2001. We expect a steadily growing share of this spending to flow into seismic purchases throughout the remainder of 2000 as our customers begin to rebuild their inventories of drillable prospects.

TGS-NOPEC specializes in the planning, acquisition, processing, interpretation and marketing of non- exclusive surveys worldwide.

The tests make use of genetic biomarkers for more than 200 genes which cover the entire immune reaction and are relevant to predicting the risk of hypersensitivity. The tests have over 90 percent reliability. This compares with the current predominant test method, experiments on mice, which has an accuracy of 70-­‐75 percent. SenzaGen's tests are also capable of measuring the potency of a substance's allergenic properties. Consequently, GARD tests provide a much more comprehensive basis for determining whether a substance should be classified as an allergen than current testing methods. About SenzaGen SenzaGen makes it possible to replace animal experiments with in vitro genetic testing to determine the allergenicity of the chemicals we come into contact with in our daily lives, such as for example in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food products and dyes. The company's patented tests are the most reliable on the market and provide more information than traditional evaluation methods. We ourselves sell the tests in Sweden and the USA, and we sell through partners in several other countries. Over the next few years the company will expand geographically, make alliances with more distribution partners and launch further unique tests. SenzaGen has its headquarters in Lund in Sweden and a subsidiary in San Francisco, USA. For more information visit www.senzagen.com About Eurosafe Eurosafe is a French based CRO. Over 30 years Eurosafe has served its customers all around the world for developing cosmetics and pharmaceuticals with 3 kinds of services : in vitro assays, tests on volunteers and regulatory toxicology. Our offering completed now with the GARDskin™ and GARDpotency™ together with our DPRA, H-­‐Clat and Sens-­‐Is assays makes Eurosafe unique in the EU with a complete set of standard and innovative sensitization assays.

116	ExpreS2ion Biotech Holding AB Press Release, 2017-October-2 Following its successful rights issue, ExpreS2ion finalises the AdaptVac joint venture Hørsholm, Denmark, October 2, 2017 – Today, ExpreS2ion Biotech Holding AB announces that the fully owned subsidiary ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies ApS (“ExpreS2ion”) and NextGen Vaccines ApS (“NextGen”) have finalised all agreements for the AdaptVac ApS (“AdaptVac”) joint venture following the successful share issue in August 2017. In addition, ExpreS2ion expects AdaptVac to release additional information on animal data and its primary breast cancer vaccine candidate within the following weeks. AdaptVac was formed to combine the unique ExpreS2 protein development and production platform with the ground-breaking Virus-Like Particle (VLP) technology developed by the founders of NextGen, a spinoff from the University of Copenhagen. AdaptVac is owned in equal parts by ExpreS2ion and NextGen and has been operating under interim management since its foundation June 2017. At a founding meeting today, Dr. Wian de Jong from ExpreS2ion was appointed CEO, whereas Dr. Adam F.S. Pedersen from NextGen was appointed CSO of the company. Dr. Steen Klysner from ExpreS2ion was appointed Chairman of the Board, which has equal representation from ExpreS2ion and NextGen. “Both companies see a big opportunity in combining our cost and time effective ExpreS2 development platform with the Virus-Like Particle technology that enables the use of vaccines and vaccine-like treatments in radical new ways. With these tools, we are also aiming to disrupt the very notion of how to treat common non-contagious diseases such as cancer and allergy”, says Dr. Steen Klysner, ExpreS2ion's CEO. Steen Klysner further explains why AdaptVac has chosen breast cancer as its lead development project: “If we can utilise the advantages of a vaccine-like treatment, such as using a simple needle injection in the patient to trigger the immune system to effectively fight the cancer tumour, it would be a major shift from the costly and resource-demanding treatments that are dominating the market today”. Strong market potential in breast cancer Breast cancer is a widespread oncology indication affecting more than 1.3 million worldwide annually and resulting in more than 450,000 deaths (Tao, 2015: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543329). The most common treatment today is based on monoclonal antibodies, where the dominating therapy HERCEPTIN (trastuzumab) generates annual global sales of US$ 7 billion. The target product profile of AdaptVac's lead breast cancer prototype is tailored to be highly competitive both in terms of cost and efficacy, thus aiming at a significant market share. About AdaptVac ApS AdaptVac is a new joint venture between ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies and NextGen Vaccines, combining ExpreS2ions platform with novel proprietary and ground-breaking Virus-Like Particle (VLP) technology, developed at the University of Copenhagen. The company aims to accelerate the development of highly efficient therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines within high value segments of oncology, infectious diseases and immunological disorders.

CMS Sitecore has become the Sitecore Experience Platform; Adobe has renamed its CQ5 CMS the Adobe Experience Manager; Acquia offers services around its open source CMS Drupal and now presents itself as ‘the digital experience company’; Progress has completed its Telerik SiteFinity CMS with a Telerik Digital Experience Cloud; Kentico 9, which combines CMS e-commerce and an online marketing platform, creates ‘exceptional customer experiences’; finally, Episerver is not a CMS but an Experience Editor, with its own Digital Experience Cloud. Emakina Group’s size and number of offices mean it can offer a wide range of these management platforms and choose the solutions that best match a customer’s needs. The range, for example, at Emakina.BE speaks for itself: Tridion (SDL), Drupal (Acquia), SharePoint (Microsoft) and Selligent are some of the platforms our teams can juggle with their eyes closed. Their list has recently expanded to include SiteFinity, following a partnership agreement with Telerik. Emakina.FR has delivered major projects using Magento, Drupal, WordPress, and Selligent. It is also becoming an IBM partner, and the artificial intelligence engine, Watson, will help enormously in designing more intelligent user experiences. Emakina.NL and Emakina.TR are masters of Demandware but they aren’t resting on their laurels: they are also experts in Episerver and will soon work with Hybris (SAP) too. At Emakina.AT/Emakina.HR, the hub of the group for central and eastern Europe, Kentico is the platform of choice. The Reference agency is a kind of reference manual itself on the Sitecore Experience Platform and, of course, Selligent. It has recently added an open source framework to its solutions: Umbraco, another star of the Microsoft universe. Emakina has experts in its main platform, Adobe Experience Manager, across the group. This specialism means that Design is Dead, after 10 years of collaboration, can come up with ever more avant-garde solutions for telecoms giant BASE. Unilever Food Solutions, Alès Groupe and Audi Belgium can pat themselves on the back about brilliant projects by Emakina.NL, Emakina.FR and Emakina.BE respectively, using this Adobe tool. User experience is now the main factor in choosing digital tools. This choice contributes directly to customers’ return on investment from our projects. Since 2001, we have been sharpening our skills and forging partnerships with platform creators so that today Emakina is the Europe’s number one independent digital agency, specialising in the user experience. OVERVIEW / P. 4 5PARTNERSHIP WITH ASIANCE From its base in Seoul, Asiance can roll out projects across Asia.

It offers its customers a full support marketing service, with a dash of scientific creativity in its campaigns. Emakina’s new structural partner Bubblegum adds its deep knowledge of the Spanish market to our international services. 2015, A YEAR FULL OF NEW THINGS DEMPSEY BECOMES EMAKINA.SE After more than two years of partnership, Emakina Group has acquired Dempsey, the Stockholm-based digital agency that specialises in creating innovative user experiences. The 16 experts at newly-named Emakina.SE work with clients in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, strengthening the Group’s position in the Nordic countries. DIAMOND:DOGS|GROUP BECOMES EMAKINA The diamond:dogs|group has been a market leader in Aus- tria, with a strong position in central and eastern Europe. Its employees are experts in web and mobile applications and it has a roster of top customers. Emakina Group’s 100% takeo- ver gives it an active regional hub, operating from offices in Vienna, Salzburg, Zurich and Zagreb. EMAKINA/THINGS RULES THE INTERNET OF THINGS A combination of mobile, wireless internet, sensors and mi- niature electronics means companies can design connected objects that facilitate and enrich their clients’ lives. Emakina’s newly-born centre of expertise, Emakina/Things, brings together all the necessary skills to create user experiences specifically for the internet of things. OVERVIEW / P. 6 7
