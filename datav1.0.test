It contains the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements, together with the Independent Auditor’s Report thereon, as required by the UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39, the Report of the Directors on pages 40 to 299 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 300 to 327 have each been drawn up in accordance with the requirements of English law, and liability in respect thereof is also governed by English law. Additional information, including commentary on 2013 compared with 2012, may be found in the Form 20-F filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) and available on www.hsbc.com and www.sec.gov. Certain defined terms Unless the context requires otherwise, ‘HSBC Holdings’ means HSBC Holdings plc and ‘HSBC’, the ‘Group’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refer to HSBC Holdings together with its subsidiaries. Within this document the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China is referred to as ‘Hong Kong’. When used in the terms ‘shareholders’ equity’ and ‘total shareholders’ equity’, ‘shareholders’ means holders of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares and those preference shares and capital securities issued by HSBC Holdings classified as equity. The abbreviations ‘US$m’ and ‘US$bn’ represent millions and billions (thousands of millions) of US dollars, respectively. Financial statements The consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and as endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’). EU endorsed IFRSs could differ from IFRSs as issued by the IASB if, at any point in time, new or amended IFRSs were not to be endorsed by the EU. At 31 December 2014, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2014 affecting these consolidated and separate financial statements, and there was no difference between IFRSs endorsed by the EU and IFRSs issued by the IASB in terms of their application to HSBC. Accordingly, HSBC’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. We use the US dollar as our presentation currency because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which we transact and fund our business. Unless otherwise stated, the information presented in this document has been prepared in accordance with IFRSs. When reference to ‘adjusted’ is made in tables or commentaries, the comparative information has been expressed at constant currency (see page 40), the impact of fair value movements in respect of credit spread charges on HSBC’s own debt has been eliminated and the effects of other significant items have been adjusted as reconciled on page 44. Adjusted return on risk-weighted assets is defined and reconciled on page 62.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about HSBC’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as ‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, ‘seeks’, ‘estimates’, ‘potential’ and ‘reasonably possible’, variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. HSBC makes no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of any forward-looking statements. Written and/or oral forward-looking statements may also be made in the periodic reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, summary financial statements to shareholders, proxy statements, offering circulars and prospectuses, press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by HSBC’s Directors, officers or employees to third parties, including financial analysts. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated or implied in any forward- looking statement. These include, but are not limited to: • changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, such as continuing or deepening recessions and fluctuations in employment beyond those factored into consensus forecasts; changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates; volatility in equity markets; lack of liquidity in wholesale funding markets; illiquidity and downward price pressure in national real estate markets; adverse changes in central banks’ policies with respect to the provision of liquidity support to financial markets; heightened market concerns over sovereign creditworthiness in over-indebted countries; adverse changes in the funding status of public or private defined benefit pensions; and consumer perception as to the continuing availability of credit and price competition in the market segments we serve; • changes in government policy and regulation, including the monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks and other regulatory authorities; initiatives to change the size, scope of activities and interconnectedness of financial institutions in connection with the implementation of stricter regulation of financial institutions in key markets worldwide; revised capital and liquidity benchmarks which could serve to deleverage bank balance sheets and lower returns available from the current business model and portfolio mix; imposition of levies or taxes designed to change business mix and risk appetite; the practices, pricing or responsibilities of financial institutions serving their consumer markets; expropriation, nationalisation, confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to foreign ownership; changes in bankruptcy legislation in the principal markets in which we operate and the consequences thereof; general changes in government policy that may significantly influence investor decisions; extraordinary government actions as a result of current market turmoil; other unfavourable political or diplomatic developments producing social instability or legal uncertainty which in turn may affect demand for our products and services; the costs, effects and outcomes of product regulatory reviews, actions or litigation, including any additional compliance requirements; and the effects of competition in the markets where we operate including increased competition from non-bank financial services companies, including securities firms; and • factors specific to HSBC, including discretionary RWA growth and our success in adequately identifying the risks we face, such as the incidence of loan losses or delinquency, and managing those risks (through account management, hedging and other techniques). Effective risk management depends on, among other things, our ability through stress testing and other techniques to prepare for events that cannot be captured by the statistical models it uses; and our success in addressing operational, legal and regulatory, and litigation challenges, notably compliance with the DPA.HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 3 S tr at eg ic R ep o rt Fi n an ci al R ev ie w C or po ra te G ov er na nc e Fi na nc ia l S ta te m en ts S h ar eh ol d er In fo rm at io n Highlights – Profit before tax was down 17% to US$18.7bn on a reported basis.

1	T h e s e a a h e a d ANNUAL repOrt 2o10ANNUAL REPORT 2o10Demand for new build started to recover in 2010 from the all-time low reported in 2009, reaching around 39 million in compensated gross tonnage (CGT) for the year. However, this level of orders still falls well short of fully utilizing global production capacity, which has grown disproportionately in recent years following the arrival of new pla- yers, especially but not only in the Far East. The Chinese shipyards are market leaders (42%), followed by the Koreans (30%), while European yards occupy a marginal position (6%) in which new orders are concentrated on high value-added vessels, especially passenger ships, but also specialized working vessels (particularly in the offshore sector) or medium-small ships for local traffic. In Europe the effects of the crisis are having a hard impact, as reflected in the number of direct job losses and consequent recourse to social buffers. By the end of the year more than 20% of the workforce, or around 40,000 workers, had been laid off, in addi- tion to an even larger number of jobs lost by subcontractors and component industries. As far as Fincantieri’s particular sectors of interest were concerned, the cruise indust- ry has displayed positive fundamentals. The CLIA (Cruise Lines International Associa- tion) reports that its ships carried 15 million passengers in 2010, compared with 13.4 million the year before, with a further increase expected in 2011. The sector’s healthy state is confirmed by the improved financial results of some of the largest cruise lines in 2010, accompanied by a return of their share prices to pre-2008- crisis levels. All this has translated into the placement of 7 new cruise ship orders (compared with 4 in the two years 2008-2009), even if two of these orders have been secured under atypical market conditions and only thanks to government assistance. Unfortunately, even in this sector, the amount of orders is not sufficient to fully utilize shipyard production capacity; this situation is likely to continue because shipowners Corrado antonini CHairMan oF FinCantiEri

The Group has created or redeveloped these assets itself, transforming them into pivotal retail leaders in the heart of their catchment area. In all, they attract a billion visitors each year. Relying on its workforce of 1 346 employ- ees and their combined expertise in development, rental property manage- ment, and asset management, Klépierre has gradually positioned itself in those regions of Europe identified as the most dynamic and buoyant in France, in Belgium, in Scandinavia, and in North- ern Italy, as well as in the major capitals of Europe. By actively rotating the assets in its portfolio, Klépierre has suc- cessfully bolstered its presence in these regions, developing shopping centers that are increasingly of premium qual- ity, compliant with the most stringent environmental standards, and seam- lessly integrated into the regions in which they are located. Places where people interact and expe- rience life, Klépierre’s shopping centers appeal to innovative retail brands look- ing for singular locations. They attract customers who are looking for a retail mix that changes ahead of the times, and who are won over by the unique combination of the one-of-a-kind shopping experiences Klépierre invents for them and the attentive customer care it delivers to them. 01ANNUAL REPORT KLEPIERRE 2013
