Acarix Interim Report JANUARY – MARCH 2017 Progress towards commercialization of CADScor®System according to plan First quarter (January – March) in 2017 compared with same period 2016 • Operating loss amounted to MSEK –3.9 (–2.3) • Net loss amounted to MSEK –3.5 (–1.5) • Net change in cash and cash equivalents amounted to MSEK –18.3 (2.4) • Earnings per share before and after dilution (weighted average) amounted to SEK –0.15 (–0.14) Events occurring after March 31, 2017 The establishment of a German subsidiary is in progress, expected to be completed in end of May 2017. Acarix has employed a total of 4 key account managers, including 3 for the German market and 1 for the Scandina- vian market. Two of them start their employment during June and the remainder in August. Acarix CADScor®System was on display at DKG 2017, the annual meeting of the German Society of Cardiology. Acarix CADScor®System was on display at Swedish Soc. of Cardiology spring meeting in Malmö, April 26-28. 1ACARIX AB (PUBL) JANUARY – MARCH 20172 Message from the CEO With the CADScor®System, Acarix can provide an easy to use, non-invasive diagnostic tool to rule out Coronary Artery Disease with a very high level of precision. This tran- slates into a potential to reduce onward patient referrals by ~50% - a “win-win” for patients, payers, and physicians. As part of our strategy to gradually increase international awareness, we presented Acarix and the CADScor®System at Medtech Showcase in San Francisco in January 2017 which ran simultaneously with the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. This provided an immediate opportunity for us to capitalize on the interest generated by the initial public offering in December 2016, and was an ideal opportunity to meet potential US and international collaborators. Also in January, we welcomed Marianne Solhøj Nørskov as our new Clinical Program Manager. She will be responsible for handling the company’s clinical program including trial partner identification, applications to authorities as well as initiation, monitoring, and reporting of clinical trials. She holds a M.Sc. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D. from the Univer- sity of Copenhagen and joins from Novo Nordisk. Furthermore, we presented Acarix and the CADScor®System at Vator Securities Unicorn Summit in Stockholm providing an update on upcoming activities. Vator Securities Unicorn Summit is a capital markets day with some of the most inte- resting and innovative companies in Sweden. Beyond com- pany presentations, participants are offered the opportunity to network with industry peers and investors. Acarix won a Danish Design Award 2017 in the category Employment Growth recognizing the potential for interna- tional success and employment growth. The Danish Design Award is a joint creation of the Danish Design Centre and the alliance of design professionals, Design Denmark. We are of course very pleased to have won this prestigious award, particularly since functional design is such an inte- gral part of the concept behind the Acarix CADScor®System. We announced the results from a new multi-center trial of the CADScor®System. The results were presented at the American College of Cardiology annual scientific meeting held in Washington, March 17-19, and showed that the CADScor®System rules out Coronary Artery Disease with 97% negative predictive value. We are delighted with the results of the trial. Coronary Artery Disease affects more than 120 million people worldwide but the current diagnos- tic pathway, which can rapidly escalate to imaging and coro- nary angiography can be significantly improved. We believe this opens the possibility of use as a frontline test, reducing patient anxiety and waiting times, as well as improving tri- age for patients needing more expensive and invasive diag- nostic modalities. I would like to express my gratitude to our investors and main shareholders for their continued trust and support and at the same time welcome all new shareholders. SINCERELY, SØREN RYSHOLT CHRISTIANSEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Dear shareholder, The first quarter of 2017 has been a busy period for Acarix preparing commencement of commercialization of the CADScor®System. We are all eager to ensure it unfolds its potential in the early ruling-out of Coronary Artery Disease.ACARIX AB (PUBL) JANUARY – MARCH 20173 Financial Report Financial result The Acarix group is launching the CADScor®System on the German, Danish and Swedish market during second quar- ter 2017 and reported no revenues during the first quarter. Operating loss for first quarter amounted to MSEK –3.9 (–2.3). Increased G&A costs relate to increased commerci- alization activities compared to same period previous year. Net loss for the quarter amounted to MSEK –3.4 (–1.5). Earnings per share amounted to SEK –0.15 (–0.14).

Cash flow In the first quarter of 2017, net cash outflow from opera- tion amounted to MSEK –16.3 compared to cash outflow of MSEK –1.5 in the first quarter of 2016. The change in working capital decreased cash flow by MSEK –12.4 (0.8) mainly driven by payment of obligations related to the IPO. Investments in non current assets amounted to MSEK 2.0 (4.3) during first quarter and consist of capitalized deve- lopment costs. Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents amounted to MSEK –18.3 (2.4). The parent company The Parent Company’s operations are primarily focused on Group-wide management and financing.

The new fulfilment centre is 43,500 square meters and equipped with an Autostore Automated Storage and Retrieval System comprising of 130 robots operating on top of an eight-meter- high grid with 130,000 bins in and more than 450,000 SKU locations. The new fulfilment centre was handed over to us on February 25 and the move commenced immediately thereafter. We managed to execute the move without any significant interruptions to the customers and we finalised it within the planned timeframe. The new warehouse has been operating as the sole fulfilment centre since March 23. The most important thing though was that the customer satisfaction ratings was unchanged during the move. Our NPS score remained at 65, and the Trustpilot score remained at 9.1 during the quarter. We opened our new cosmetics store, Beauty by Boozt at the very end of the quarter (March 31) in Roskilde west of Copenhagen. This opening marks our entry in the beauty and cosmetics category and will be followed by the launch of the beauty category on Boozt.com in the beginning of June. The beauty category on Boozt.com will present a confident selection from key beauty brand owners like L’Oréal and Estée Lauder featuring super-brands like Lancôme, Biotherm, Clarins, Bobbi Brown and Clinique. We continued our strong growth in the first quarter of 2017. Our net revenue was SEK 421.1 million (259.7), representing a growth of 62.1%. The quarter was affected by the gradual phasing out of the ECCO mono brand agreement that ended March 31, affecting the "Other" segment negatively. The other two segments, Boozt.com and Booztlet.com, realised a revenue growth of 68.8% respectively 101.9%, showing continuous strong momentum for our own multi-brand stores. Hermann Haraldsson, CEO "The move demonstrated a team effort, discipline and competence that is second to none, and is a strong testimony of the execution power of our people" Comments from CEO Hermann Haraldsson "We continued our strong growth in the first quarter of 2017 "
Interim report January – March 20122 (20) | TradeDoubler Interim report January – March 2012 Challenging start to 2012 (Numerical data in brackets refers to the corresponding period in 2011 unless otherwise stated). THE INTERIM PERIOD JANUARY – MARCH 2012  Net sales amounted to SEK 640.2 M (652.6), and adjusted for changes in exchange rates, net sales fell by 2%.  Gross profit amounted to SEK 146.4 M (157.3), and adjusted for changes in exchange rates, gross profit fell by 7%.  The market units France and South East accounted for approx. 2/3 of the fall in gross profit.  Strong performance in Technology segment with 22% gross profit growth, adjusted for changes in exchange rates.  Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to SEK 12.6 M (34.8), and adjusted for changes in exchange rates, operating profit fell by 64%.  Costs increased by SEK 11.2 M in total, mainly due to the strengthening of the sales organisation and change projects aimed at boosting cost-efficiency and competitiveness.  Cash flow from operating activities was SEK -9.0 M (41.8), primarily due to lower sales.  Earnings per share amounted to SEK 0.24 (0.47). PRESENTATION OF THE INTERIM REPORT The interim report will be presented at a press and analyst conference on 3 May at 10.00 a.m. in TradeDoubler’s premises at Sveavägen 20.

After a satisfactory Christmas trade, the start of the year was weaker than we anticipated. The negative economic and political climate, especially in Southern Europe is having an effect on consumption. This particularly affected our market units France and South East, which combined accounted for 2/3 of the fall in gross profit. Business with our key customer group of international brands developed in a stable manner during the first quarter and we continued to win important new deals, and to develop our existing base. In this case, we meet both demands for advanced solutions, and for efficient uniform delivery in a large number of countries. The large transaction volumes with corresponding lower margins point to the importance of scale and cost efficiency. In line with our strategy, we initiated comprehensive new projects during the previous quarter in order to raise cost- efficiency and strengthen competitiveness. Among other things, the work involves automation and centralization of processes, not least by raising productivity in the deliveries to clients, improving working methods and enhancing financial and production systems. This is a project which means that we are in a period of relatively high project costs and investments. However, we are convinced that these are necessary measures in order to be able to deliver Europe’s best advertising network in the longer term. We continued to raise the tempo of our product development work. We released new functionality within several areas during the quarter which has been received positively, thus strengthening our competitiveness. The work on securing mobile revenue flows and on assisting our clients with generating better business is continuing at a fast pace. We released mobile affiliate programmes, tracking of transactions on mobile sites, in apps, and new functionality that is capable of tracking downloaded apps as well as optimising and measuring efficiency. In addition, we are building up operations in new markets for us, such as in Latin America and in Russia. This is occupying several of our employees and also implies other costs, which is a necessary investment for the future. Many of these markets offer tremendous opportunities in the longer term, especially Brazil where consumers already today spend USD 10 billion via the Internet. The launch of our large client in Brazil exceeded expectations and we are now gradually increasing our presence in Brazil in a cost-efficient manner in line with increasing business. In conclusion, despite the challenging start to 2012 with unsatisfactory earnings during the quarter, I am pleased that we saw a very good development of our business within Technology, continued high transaction activity with both existing and new clients, and that we have already initiated several measures for improving future earnings. Urban Gillström President and CEO4 (20) | TradeDoubler Interim report January – March 2012 MARKET DEVELOPMENT After a strong Christmas trade, 2012 started off weaker in TradeDoubler’s core Affiliate business. The economic downturn and political instability are leading to caution among advertisers and consumers, particularly in Southern Europe and France. In Affiliate, competition is becoming more intense. However, online marketing continues to be an effective way to drive business on the Internet. Every euro spent in Affiliate generates 19 euro in sales, on average, according to a current survey [Baromètre Affiliation Bilan 2011 – CPA]. In Campaigns, a structural shift is occurring that will alter the competitive picture. New phenomena and actors are offering an increased degree of automation, which combined with dynamic pricing via “ad exchanges” changes the conditions in the market. The potential for growth in European e-commerce is still good, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe where the proportion of consumers who shop via the Internet is lower than in Northern Europe. TRENDS TradeDoubler’s most important segment is the travel sector, where the Internet is one of the most important channels. For a number of years, the sector has grown faster than the economy as a whole with a rising share of bookings via Internet. In 2012, the trade organisation World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) predicts that the European travel and tourism sector will only grow by 0.3 percent. The online part is expected to continue to gain ground. The rapid spread of mobile devices has repercussions for e- commerce. Consumers act a bit differently on such devices than in traditional e-commerce, and behaviour also differs between smartphones and tablets. The most common activity is to compare prices, which can easily be done in a shop, for example. It is also believed that consumers prefer to shop from tablets than from mobiles. Naturally, it is important for e-tailers to be part of this development and TradeDoubler sees a strong interest in adapting marketing activities to mobile devices. This interest is estimated to be particularly important for ”medium considered purchases” such as in Fashion & Accessories, Computer Software and Entertainment. E-tailers that have the Internet as the only channel are considered to lead the development in adaptation to mobile devices. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT At the end of the quarter, TradeDoubler released new functionality for transactions on mobile devices. This enables mobile affiliate programmes, tracking of transactions on mobile sites, in apps, and new functionality that is capable of tracking downloaded apps as well as optimising and measuring efficiency. The release of the new technology has been received positively by clients by way of introduction. TradeDoubler also introduced AdCodes which makes it possible for publishers to set aside a special area on their website for automated dynamic adverts from TradeDoubler. TradeDoubler then continually fills this space with new optimised content. The service was introduced in selected markets during the first quarter and is now being gradually introduced in further markets. The next release is voucher codes, which are being introduced together with a new way to make tools available to external developers who are at the cutting edge technologically. Voucher codes are a powerful way to get consumers to execute purchases when they visit certain websites, for example for price comparisons. THE GROUP’S RESULTS Consolidated net sales during the first quarter amounted to SEK 640.2 M (652.6) MSEK, a decline of 2 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Gross profit was SEK 146.4 M (157.3), a fall of 7 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates and the gross margin decreased to 22.9 (24.1) per cent. For Network, gross profit amounted to SEK 132.1 (145.4), a fall of 10 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Gross profit for Technology rose to SEK 14.3 M (11.9), an increase of 22 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Operating costs including depreciation for the first quarter amounted to SEK 133.7 M (122.5), an increase of 9 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. The group is carrying out comprehensive change management efforts aimed at boosting cost efficiency, which imply a higher cost level in the current phase. The work covers both system and business development. The sales organisation has also been strengthened. Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to SEK 12.6 M (34.8), a decrease of 64 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Essentially, the fall was equally due to the decline in gross profit and higher costs. The operating/gross profit margin fell to 8.6 (22.1) per cent. Financial income and expenses amounted to SEK 0.3 M (-8.9). The Group had no interest-bearing loans at the end of the quarter (0.0). Profit after tax was SEK 10.1 M (20.0), a decrease of 50 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. The tax rate was 21.8 (22.6) per cent. NETWORK Gross profit during the first quarter amounted to SEK 132.1 M (145.4), a decline of 10 per cent, adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Gross profit fell in all market units. The largest declines were in the units France and South East which combined accounted for two thirds of the fall. In Central, the performance in the Netherlands also contributed to reducing the gross profit. Measures are being taken here to reverse the negative development. Operating profit (EBIT) during the first quarter amounted to SEK 5.0 M (29.3), a decrease of 82 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Operating profit weakened in all market units. The largest market unit, Central, achieved a gross profit of SEK 31.5 M (32.3) during the first quarter, a fall of 4 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. The market unit is growing within Affiliate where both international and local clients

Important Events After the Period  No important events have occurred after the periodINVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL.) | Interim Report January – March 2013 2 CEO’s Comments It is with great pleasure I inform you that INVISIO shows a positive result this quarter – for the first time* in the company's about ten-year history. The operating profit was SEK 1.6 m this quarter, which also showed the highest total income ever (SEK 27.0 m). The reason is the record order totaling SEK 32 m from the Armed Forces of a NATO country through a leading radio manufacturer that we received by the end of 2012. The order that was our by far largest ever was for a number of units of our new advanced communications system INVISIO V60. The majority of the order was delivered during this quarter, which contributed significantly to the positive result. In addition, we received a number of additional orders during the quarter, among them a large SEK 6.3 m order from a new customer. This is historic for INVISIO and demonstrates that our business model works well and that we are on the right track. The increase in total income during the quarter has been achieved without increased operating expenses and shows that our current organization is ready to handle increased volumes. With the current gross margin and costs, INVISIO needs a total annual income of about SEK 100 m to show profit. INVISIO begins 2013 with the best quarter ever and a relatively large order book going into the second quarter (SEK 10.6 m). We expect a considera- ble growth in sales during the year as we have numer- ous client trials and large offers outstanding, but it is very difficult to determine which quarters these orders will possibly come in. Thus there are conditions for a profitable 2013 and the coming years, but it is too early to give comments about the expected outcome for 2013. 10+ YEARS OF HISTORY – 5 YEAR OLD COMPANY INVISIO was founded for more than ten years ago with main focus on the consumer market. Five years ago a completely new strategy for the company was imple- mented and since 2008 we focus on the market for professional users of communications equipment and have seen a number of improvements:  Increased sales each year (see graph) and a reduc- tion of costs.  A broadened product portfolio from headsets only to communication solutions with headsets, control units and accessories for use with two-way radio.  A substantial increase in the number of sales leads, queries and full-scale customer trials.  A larger customer base and considerably more recurring customers. By the change of strategy in 2008, we did not anticipate that the lead times in the sales work towards above all military users would be as long as proven to be. From that our products has been established and gained trust among smaller groups of users, so called “innovators” that in our case for example are military Special Forces, the process of establishing among larger groups of users (“early adopters”) has taken longer than expected. There is however no doubt that our solutions receive an increasingly larger interest and demand. We can also show a very large number of satisfied users. Our prod- ucts are literally “proven in combat” in Afghanistan. LARGE POTENTIAL IN MILITARY PROGRAMS The new record order shows that we can successfully offer on what is known as the volume market, for exam- ple military modernization programs with orders of thou- sands of units. We see good possibilities for continued sales in connection with this type of programs. Sales may however vary from quarter to quarter due to long lead times from first contact with customer, to inquiry, to customer testing, to quotation and to firm order. We believe in continued sales opportunities for the commu- nications- and hearing protection system INVISIO V60 and are noticing a lot of interest from existing and new customers in the solution, which is currently being test- ed by a number of potential military customers in vari- ous countries. One trend that we are observing more and more is the demand for hearing protection in com- munication solutions, which suits INVISIO well as we have world leading technology in the field and a number of very good solutions within the area. ONLY ONE BUSINESS AREA From now on we will no longer divide into the business areas Professional Products and Consumer Products. INVISIO focuses all resources on the professional products and do not actively seek new collaborations on the consumer market. The need for consumers and professions that use mobile phones during work to be able to communicate in noisy and demanding environ- ments remains. Our judgement is that long-term there is good potential for INVISIO’s patented technology on the consumer market. Last but not least I want to really thank all our employ- ees that have worked hard to reach a positive result for the quarter. Lars Højgård Hansen, CEO  An increase in the number of resellers and strategic cooperations with for example manufacturers of radio equipment. *With exception from the first quarter 2009 when INVISIO sold the VoIP-patent. INVISIO’s sales in million SEK per year since 2008 – record every year.INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL.) | Interim Report January – March 2013 3 Total Income and Result January – March 2013 Total income during the first quarter increased compared with the corresponding period 2012 and amounted to SEK 27.0 m (6.3). Gross profit amounted to SEK 11.9 m (2.7) and the gross margin was 44.3 percent (43.0). It is characteristic that the gross margin may vary from quarter to quarter depending on product mix and on the share of direct sales to end-customers – with higher margins – compared with the share of sales made through distributors. The order book was SEK 10.6 m (7.8) at the end of the quarter. Operating expenses for the first quarter was SEK 10.3 m (10.5). Included in the expenses are depreciations of SEK 1.4 m (1.0). Operating profit for the first quarter thus amounted to SEK 1.6 m (-7.8). Net financial items for the first quarter amounted to SEK -0.7 m (-0.7). Profit after tax for the first quarter amounted to SEK 0.9 m (-8.5). Profit per share for the first quarter amounted to SEK 0.02 (-0.25). Capital Expenditure, Cash flow and Liquidity, Financing and Shareholders’ Equity CAPITAL EXPENDITURE During the first quarter net capital expenditures amounted to SEK -1.1 m (-1.4) of which -1.1 m (-1.4) was activated development costs. CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Cash flow from the operating activities during the first quarter amounted to SEK -1.2 m (-3.7). Cash flow from the investment activities amounted to SEK -1.1 m (-1.4). Cash flow from the fi- nancing activities amounted to SEK -1.0 m (-10.9). Cash flow during the period thus amounted to SEK -3.3 m (-16.0). At the end of the period, cash and cash equivalents of the Group amounted to SEK 0.9 m (4.2). Of the Company’s total loans of SEK 29.9 m per last March, SEK 7.9 m concerns factoring. The remaining SEK 22 m concerns three-year loans that are free of amortization during 2013. The Company management and Board continue to work actively and continuously with the Com- pany’s governance and control, including earnings, liquidity and financial position. The Board is also continuously evaluating that the conditions for further operations are fulfilled. It is not possi- ble to exclude the possibility that the Company might need additional capital until the business generates a positive cash flow. The view held by the Company management and Board is the same as previously, namely that necessary liquidity and financing will be generated and added to operations though continuing income, borrowing, and the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting to carry out new issues or such. FINANCING INVISIO received during the first quarter a loan of SEK 15 m from a leading Swedish commercial bank. The loan currency has been used to pay a previous loan from Alecta of SEK 10 m and a loan of SEK 5 m from Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag. The loan from the bank is free of amortization charges during 2013 and will be amortized with SEK 6 m in 2014 and with SEK 9 m in 2015. Yggdrasil has guaranteed the loan from the bank with SEK 15 m. INVISIO has pledged the secu- rities against Yggdrasil instead of as previously against Alecta and Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag. INVISIO will pay an annual guarantee commission of 3.5 percent to Yggdrasil and the board of INVISIO has the view that the agreement with Yggdrasil is according to market conditions. INVISIO received during the first quarter a three-year loan of SEK 4.2 million from Almi Företags- partner AB. This loan will require no repayments in 2013. INVISIO has provided securities in form of a pledge of shares in the subsidiary Nextlink IPR AB. Terms of the loan is that the equity ratioINVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL.) | Interim Report January – March 2013 4 of the Group amounts to no less than 10 percent per end of June 2013 and remains so during the term of the loan. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Group’s reported shareholders’ equity at the end of the period amounted to SEK -1.5 m (2.3), which resulted into a negative equity ratio (7 percent). Parent Company Net income for the Parent Company during the first quarter amounted to SEK 15.000 (15.000). Operating loss amounted to SEK -1.1 m (-1.4). The period’s result was SEK -1.5 m (-1.8). At the end of the period, cash and cash equivalents held by the Parent Company amounted to SEK 0 m (0) and shareholders’ equity amounted to SEK 61.2 m (77.9), which resulted into an equity ratio of 71.9 (83.3). The Parent Company had 1 employee (1). Accounting Principles This Interim Report for the Group has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The Parent Company's accounts have been prepared in accordance with RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities and the Swedish Annual Ac- counts Act. The accounting principles that are described in the 2012 Annual Report have been applied. Significant Risks and Uncertainties INVISIO’s business and earnings are affected by a number of external and internal factors. A continuous process is conducted to identify all risks and to assess how each respective risk shall be managed. The risks that the Company is mainly exposed to are market-related risks (including legislation and political decisions, global economic situation, competition, technological risks and market acceptance of new products and dependency of suppliers), operational risks (including the ability to manage growth, customers and cooperation agreements, product liability, immaterial rights, dependence on key persons and employees, as well as risks related to financial reporting) and financial risks (including primarily currency risk, financing risks and liquidity risks). In the Company's opinion, no additional significant risks or uncertainties have arisen during the year, apart from those reported in this Interim Report and on the pages 42-44 and 57-58 in the Annual Report for 2012. As noted in the section "Cash Flow and Liquidity", the Company management and Board are working actively and continuously with the Company's governance and control, including earnings, liquidity and financial position. The Board continuously tests that the conditions for continued operation exist. It is not possible to exclude the possibility that the Company might need addi- tional capital until the business reaches break-even. The view held by the Company management and Board is the same as previously, namely that necessary liquidity and financing will be gener- ated and added to operations though continuing income, borrowing, and the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting to carry out new issues or such. Related Party Transactions Lage Jonason with related parties is one of the Company's largest individual shareholders. Lage Jonason has personally stood surety for some of the Company's undertakings vis-à-vis suppliers. Lage Jonason has the right to 1.5 percent annual reimbursement concerning his surety.
Press release Catena’s mission is to own, effectively manage and pro-actively develop properties in prime locations that offer the potential to generate a steadily growing cash flow and favourable value growth. Catena’s overriding goal, based on its focused orientation, is to give shareholders a favourable long-term total return. As of 31 March 2018, the properties had a total value of SEK 13,424.2 million. Catena AB is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. This information is such that Catena AB (publ) is obliged to publish under the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

No. 556294-1715, Registered office: Solna catenafastigheter.se 26 April 2018, 2.30 p.m. Interim Report January - March 2018 • Rental income increased by 24 percent to SEK 263.2 million (211.5). • Net operating surplus increased by 23 percent to SEK 192.6 million (156.7). • Profit from property management increased by 25 percent to SEK 135.9 million (108.4). • Profit for the period increased to SEK 176.6 million (176.3), corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 4.72 (4.94), including changes in value of SEK 86.8 million (58.5). • Net asset value per share, EPRA NAV, increased to SEK 155.92 (139.18). Catena continued to show improved profitability and continued growth in the first quarter. This success can be attributed to Catena’s ability to quickly identify customer needs as logistics becomes an increasingly important part of efficient retailing, due to new trends in consumption and purchasing patterns. Since the end of the first quarter of 2017, several new facilities have been added, both through new production and acquisitions. Strong finances together with our land reserve of approximately 1,700,000 square metres also enable continued growth, and six projects are currently up and running. In the latter part of 2017 and during the first quarter of this year, we noted increased interest from investors, particularly foreign investors, interested in logistics properties. We are seeing this, for instance, at the meetings with investors that we are regularly invited to – and the interest is reflected in our share price, which has been boosted by inclusion in the international property index EPRA. We can deliver added value when our customers’ needs for effective logistics solutions increase, and we are well-positioned to accommodate new consumption and purchasing patterns among our customers. In addition to e-commerce, we see growing needs among our customers within food, restaurant and catering logistics, both for new innovative solutions and central locations. In spring 2019, a new customer for us, Chefs Culinar, will move into a new distribution centre to become the third establishment in our major development area, Sunnanå, outside Malmö. Consumption has developed favourably in recent quarters, but even if the market levels out, this can benefit Catena, which is financially strong. Secured interest rates also in-crease resilience to changing conditions in the financial markets, relative to competitors. Attractive interest rates along with an advantageous loan structure entail proposed tax changes not being expected to have any significant impact on Catena’s earnings.” Says CEO Benny Thögersen in his comments on the Interim Report.

Around 170 lung transplants are performed every year in Australia. Private placement of SEK 181 million with the aim of being able to take XVIVO’s heart transplant project faster to the market. Development team for the heart transplant project established in Lund. The Netherlands new country with XPS™. Around 100 lung transplants are performed every year in the Netherlands. CEO’S COMMENTS The development of XVIVO Perfusion is progressing at a rapid pace. Use of the products in the field of lung transplantation is con- tinuing to grow strongly – growth excluding capital goods was +16 percent in the first quarter – and is spreading to new markets. In this quarter Australia and the Netherlands were added to countries with access to XPS™. The sales organization was strengthened in Europe towards the end of the previous year and we are delighted that this reinforcement showed positive results as early as the begin- ning of this year, with a sales increase of 50 percent for single-use products for warm perfusion outside the American region. In the US the lung study for the strategically important PMA application is in its final phase and now only 6 patients remain to be included. In parallel, upgrades of the XPS sys- tem have been launched, making it easier to use, which the company judges will have a positive long-term effect on sales. Finally, it can be noted that the entire lung transplantation area is developing well and is profitable. As part of the long-term goal of becoming the global leader in the field of organ perfusion, with the aim of ensuring growth and profitability in the longer term, the company is investing in development work for four new indications: heart transplantation, liver transplantation, isolated organ therapy and priming solutions for heart-lung machines. This work is progressing according to plan and the R&D organization was strengthened during the quarter to carry out this development. The company assessed that an injection of capital was necessary in order to capitalize as quickly as possible on the potential offered by the development of the new indications. The main reason for issuing new shares was to be able to take XVIVO’s heart transplant project to the market more quickly through global market approval and market launch. Furthermore, XVIVO Perfusion will also develop other indica- tions and products more quickly. It was therefore pleasing to note that the new share issue, which was communicated dur- ing the first quarter and completed in April, rapidly became fully subscribed and that this was due to well-reputed inves- tors: The Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund, Norron, The Third Swedish National Pension Fund and Swedbank Robur. The focus in the lung transplantation area is to expand the installation base of the XPS™ and LS™ in the world and in parallel to increase the resources regarding training and ser- vice so as to support the transplantation clinics in their efforts to increase the percentage of transplantations of donated organs. The focus of XVIVO’s research is to continue to lead the development of innovative solutions within thorax sur- gery, and to develop and extend the use of perfusion of more organs for transplantation. The company is also conducting research to treat isolated organs and tissue, one example of which is the indication of cancer.

Interim report January-March 20172 Earnings per share up 33% Summary for January-March 2017  Net sales SEK 192 M (157)  Profit before tax SEK 24,4 M (18,0)  Operating margin 13,7 % (12,4)  Earnings per share before dilution SEK 0,64 (0,48)  Cash flow from operations SEK 98,8 M (84,0)  Vitec is traded on Mid Cap Nasdaq Stockholm CEO’s comments The year starts with a positive trend, for the first quarter cash flow as well as earnings and sales increases, making the quarter the historically strongest first quarter. No major events for the first quarter, the period has been characterized by daily work with deliveries, development, sales and a continuous pursuit of increased efficiency. With Vitec's niche-oriented operations, in relatively mature markets, demand is both long-term and sustainable. In such markets, efficiency and focus are key prerequisites for good and increasing profitability. We rarely face major unexpected changes in the market, which also means that the company's development is largely in our own hands. Therefore, focus and efficiency will always remain key issues in the business. The operating margin is for the quarter below our target of fifteen percent, but the trend is currently positive and the target for the operating margin is intact. The number of active acquisition dialogues remains high, and we continuously put resources in place to maintain and further develop these dialogues. Vitec's financial position and readiness for future acquisitions are good, and we see good conditions for continued acquisition-based growth. A clear shift from traditional license sales to subscription of cloud-based systems reduces reliance on individual license sales, which increases our long-term ability to control our business. This, together with our people’s capacity to innovate and integrate acquisitions, provides good conditions for long- term development of our business. With the acquisition of well-established companies and a high proportion of recurring revenues, Vitec continues the path to act in several independent and specialized niches to achieve sustainable profitable growth. Lars Stenlund, CEO3 January-March 2017 For the period, Vitec reports continued revenue growth, with an operating profit that grows faster than revenue. Our continuous efforts in all business areas, to become more efficient and move the business toward recurring revenue strengthen the Group's performance and predictability.

The latter initiative has given a good outcome for our GIS system. Business Area Real Estate Business Area Real Estate reports revenue growth and improved operating profit compared with the same period in 2016.

Business Area Finance & Insurance Business Area Finance & Insurance reports revenue growth with improved operating profit compared to the same period last year. For the Swedish market have we released a new product named Wealth Planning. The target group are banks, financial institutions and insurance companies that work with private counseling.

In Norway have we successfully moved the server operations of our software to our new data center in Oslo. Business Area Health Business Area Health reports increased sales with a slightly lower operating profit compared with the same period in 2016. Final delivery of the major projects that have been running in 2016 continues according to plan, final delivery will take place during the first half of 2017. Recurring revenue continues to increase in the company and increase the period of just over 8% Business Area Environment Business Area Environment, new from second half of 2016, has no comparative figures for the quarter. The business provide software for waste management in Finland. The integration of the business is running according to plan so also the daily operations. During the quarter, the business area delivered a new solution that makes our products even more mobile, which facilitates customers to conduct their work in a more flexible manner. Business Area Estate Agents Business Broker reports lower profit and revenue compared with the same period in 2016. In Sweden, the period characterized by a high rate of development of Vitec Express.

1 IMPACT COATINGS AB (PUBL), INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-MARCH 2018 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD  Coating production to Michelin’s fuel cell manufacturing  Delayed delivery to Huaqing Power Technology (China) FINANCIAL RESULTS FIRST QUARTER 2018  Net sales amounted to SEK 7 141 thousand (18 451)  Operating profit amounted to SEK -6 102 thousand (-404)  Net income after financial items amounted to SEK -6 121 thousand (-406)  Cash flow amounted to SEK -3 766 thousand (-12 159)  Equity-to-assets ratio amounted to 88,9% (69,3) CEO’S COMMENTARY During the period, we have continued working on our intensified efforts primarily in the Chinese fuel cells market, but also in greater Asia, Europe and North America. We see a continued strong interest in our offering and we receive increasing evidence that we have the best fuel cell coating on the market. This is based on verifications we receive from auto manufacturers that test our coatings. Important European order Interest is greatest in the Chinese market and it is there things are moving quickest. We see, however, an increased interest even in the European market, highlighted by the order from Michelin regarding production of Ceramic MAXPHASE™-coatings on fuel cell plates for their fuel cell manufacturing. The Michelin order is small but important, giving us tailwinds in discussions with other players in Europe as well as Asia. We also see a high interest from the European auto industry for our coating systems for vehicle reflectors. Long lead times It takes time, however, for discussions and verifications to become concrete business deals. International auto manufacturers have lead times of five to seven years from the start of a new model development program to the start of production.2 In the Chinese market the time is shorter, but it involves in any case a couple of years. The market suffers at times from long lead times to produce newly constructed metal plates for fuel cells, i.e., the plates that we coat. It can take four to twelve months from drawing board to delivery. Several producers of metal plates are addressing this problem and are working to reduce the lead times. With respect to China, it has been relatively calm during the beginning of the year. It is normally difficult to close deals in China during the start of the year. The Chinese New Year falls in the middle of our first quarter, and causes a calm period both before and after. Due to the above factors, we have not been able to report any larger order during the quarter. As we reported in January, we have even received certain delays to the delivery of coating systems to the Chinese fuel cell manufacturer Huaqing Power Technology. Clearer business approach During the start of the year, we have worked on creating a clearer business approach with respect to our customers, to avoid negative surprises in new markets. The approach entails that orders are not considered valid until pre-payment has been made, a Letter of Credit is issued, or the payment in some other way has been secured. Orders shall include only those coating systems meant for delivery near- term and for which customers have verified payment through pre-payment or where the payment is otherwise secured. Demo center and sales initiatives During the period, we have begun our initiatives on marketing and sales, including development of a demo center. The planned work toward creating a representative demo center in Linköping has begun. We are building two machines, one to demonstrate coating of fuel cell plates and one for vehicle reflectors. The machines can also be delivered to customers in the event a fast turnaround is needed. We have during the period strengthened the marketability of our offering and begun recruiting personnel to strengthen our sales capability. We have even streamlined our branding strategy and henceforth will market all of our coating machines under the product family name INLINECOATER™ and our coating processes under the product family name MAXPHASE™. Our partner and distributor Optorun is intensifying its work to achieve the goals of our agreement. The Japanese company has during the quarter initiated a recruiting process to further strengthen the sales team and thereby increase sales of our coating systems. With these actions and activities in place, we see a bright future ahead. Linköping 2018-04-20 Henrik Ljungcrantz, CEO Impact Coatings3 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Net sales during the period amounted to SEK 7 141 thousand (18 451). Operating expenses amounted to SEK -13 243 thousand (18 855). Operating profit before depreciation and other operating expenses amounted to SEK -6 102 thousand (- 404). Operating profit before tax amounted to SEK -6 121 thousand (-406). Cash flow amounted to SEK -3 766 thousand (-12 159). As in previous years’ reporting, no provision for deferred tax assets has been made. Financial position and liquidity Liquid assets amounted to SEK 61 620 thousand (9 988) at the end of the period. Work in progress not yet invoiced (accrued revenue) amounted to SEK 12 983 thousand (10 280) at the end of the period. Corresponding invoiced, not completed revenue (deferred revenue) amounted to SEK 9 778 thousand (1 842). Equity-to-assets ratio amounted to 88,9% (69,3). Cash flow from operations during the period amounted to SEK -3 696 thousand (-12 159). Cash flow from financing amounted to SEK -70 thousand (0). Total cash flow for the period was SEK -3 766 thousand (-12 159). SALES AND MARKET In conjunction with the fuel cell conference FC Expo held in Tokyo in February, we launched INLINECOATER™FC for the Asian market. The coating system is significantly improved in terms of productivity and is optimized for coating fuel cell plates in volume production. The launch will continue during the Hannover Messe to be held 23-27 April 2018. The cooperation with Optorun continues with work ongoing for existing as well as new potential customers. With support from Impact Coatings in Sweden, customer offerings are being shaped that meet market demands of advanced coating systems. During the recent quarter, Optorun has started the recruiting process to further strengthen the sales team in order to intensify sales of Impact Coatings coating systems, and achieve the agreed goals in the cooperation agreement. Optorun has recently completed a successful IPO and is now listed on the Japanese stock exchange. Below we describe the status in the market segments where Impact Coatings is primarily focusing: Fuel Cells and Reflectors. The company also is working actively in Metallization/Decorative coatings and Electrical contacts. As a step toward focusing the marketing of coating systems and coatings, partly new product names were launched during the quarter. All of the company’s coating systems now fall under the product family name INLINECOATER™.4 Fuel cells Huaqing Power Technology has had to delay their start of production. As announced earlier via press release, this implies the delivery of the agreed coating system is pushed forward. China Hydrogen Energy, to which our deliveries have been delayed, is in negotiations with a larger player that is planning to take a majority ownership stake in the company. These negotiations are ongoing, and when they are complete a new timeplan for production and delivery of Impact Coatings coating systems will be agreed. Telos Auto, with which Impact Coatings has a cooperation agreement, is planning to migrate to metal fuel cell plates. Impact Coatings is now coating plates from Telos Auto on a testing basis for verification of Ceramic MAXPHASE™ in their fuel cell system. Impact Coatings has delivered coated plates in accordance with a disclosed order to a leading East Asian auto manufacturer. The time plan is aggressive and all parties involved are working together to evaluate the coating as quickly as possible. Fuel cell production for Michelin has started at Impact Coatings’ facility in Linköping. The work comprises the starting phase of a process through which Michelin will be able to deliver its first fuel cell system to customers. Volumes are expected to increase over time. Symbio FCell has also received coatings from Impact Coatings during the period. The number of potential customers has increased following the FC Expo in Tokyo, which is the world’s largest fuel cell conference. At the moment, we are following up contacts with prospective customers through their visiting Impact Coatings in Linköping, and production for evaluation of coatings is starting. Several of these potential customers need scalable production lines for coatings within the near future. Reflectors Impact Coatings sees a continued increasing interest from the automotive industry in our coating system for reflectors. Above all, the possibility of integrating Impact Coatings’ system in the production flow is generating interest. The company is negotiating with several reflector producers, which in turn deliver to auto manufacturers. Impact Coatings has during the period developed a new application regarding coating of radar emblems. Radar emblems are a fundamental component in an application that is integrated in cars to increase safety through avoidance of pedestrians, obstacles, or other vehicles. The radar is placed behind the emblem in the car’s grill and the emblem therefore needs to have a special transparent coating. Impact Coatings has a competitive technology to coat radar emblems, and the market and customers are principally the same as for reflectors.
1 AAK’s Interim Report for the first quarter, 2012 Chief Executive´s comments Record high first quarter results and again strong growth in Food Ingredients Operating profit for the first quarter of 2012 reached SEK 220 million (204), an improvement of 8 percent compared with the corresponding quarter in 2011. Business Area operating profit:  Food Ingredients reached a record high first quarter of SEK 137 million (104), an improvement of 32 percent.  Chocolate & Confectionery Fats was stable at SEK 81 million (81).  Technical Products & Feed had another challenging quarter but reached SEK 25 million (39). Operating profit per kilo continued to improve, from SEK 0.59 to SEK 0.60 due to a higher proportion of value added products. We also recorded, as predicted, a record high first quarter cash flow of SEK 384 million. Earnings per share increased, from SEK 3.38 to SEK 3.43 despite higher interest costs. Sales amounted to SEK 4,222 million (3,843) in the first quarter. Volume and business development The first quarter was characterized by a Group volume growth of 7 percent. Food Ingredients reported volume up by 12 percent compared to last year, comprising increased value added products and the impact of the Golden Foods/ Golden Brands acquisition (now renamed AAK Louisville). This is fully in line with the strategy and the action plans defined in AAK Acceleration. Volumes in Chocolate & Confectionery Fats were stable (unchanged). Commodity volumes in Technical Products & Feed were down. AAK – Ongoing rationalization programs The ongoing productivity improvements in the Scandinavian and UK units continue in line with plans. AAK Acceleration We continue to see very positive effects of the AAK Acceleration program, in terms of organic growth in speciality products, acquisitive growth and in productivity. Concluding remarks The impact on our industry from the more difficult general economy in Europe is difficult to predict. However, based on AAK’s customer value propositions for health and reduced costs, customer product co-development and solutions approach, and the AAK Acceleration program (Growth-Efficiency-People), we remain prudently optimistic for the future mainly driven by a very strong Food Ingredients business.

Net sales Net sales increased by SEK 379 million mainly due to increased volumes; a better product mix; and a minor positive currency translation impact of SEK 40 million. Operating result A record high operating profit for the first quarter reached SEK 220 million (204), an improvement of 8 percent. The impact of currency translation was negligible. AAK Louisville has started to contribute to the Group result according to plan. Operating profit per kilo increased from SEK 0.59 to SEK 0.60. Speciality volumes continued to increase whilst low margin commodity volumes decreased. Net financial cost Net financial cost amounted to SEK 24 million (15), mainly as a consequence of the January 2011 refinancing. The first quarter of 2011 was impacted positively by effects of financial derivatives, mainly of a non- recurring nature. Investments Group investments amounted to SEK 108 million (68), mainly routine maintenance investments and the capacity expansion in the US. Cash flow Cash flow from operating activities excluding changes in working capital amounted to SEK 245 million (204). Further positive cash flow arose from a reduction in working capital by SEK 139 million in the first quarter (negative 562). Cash flow from operating activities including changes in working capital was SEK 384 million (negative 358). After net investments of SEK 107 million (68), positive cash flow amounted to SEK 277 million (negative 426). Since year end 2011 the main raw material prices have increased by slightly more than 10 percent which most likely will have an impact, with a time lag of six to nine months, increasing working capital during the later part of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. Financial position The equity/assets ratio amounted to 39 percent (36 percent at 31 December 2011). Net debt at 31 March 2012 amounted to SEK 2,858 million (SEK 3,141 million on 31 December 2011). At 31 March 2012, the Group had total credit facilities of SEK 6,000 million. Employees The average number of employees at 31 March 2012 was 2,056 (2,065 on 31 December 2011). The net change consists of a reduction in Scandinavia and the UK in line with the restructuring programs, offset by increases in focused growth markets.

The volume growth comprised increased speciality volumes and new volumes from the acquisition of AAK Louisville which was partly offset by refocusing in the UK market on speciality products and consequently reduced commodity volumes. Net sales Net sales increased by SEK 349 million mainly due to increased volumes, a better product mix and a minor positive currency translation impact. Operating result A record high operating profit for the first quarter reached SEK 137 million (104), an increase of 32 percent. The impact of currency translation was negligible. The first quarter continued to demonstrate strong development in many speciality product areas, in particular Bakery, Dairy Fat Alternatives and Infant Nutrition. Accordingly, operating profit per kilo in this business area continued to improve, up 17 percent from SEK 0.54 per kilo to 0.63 SEK per kilo. We remain clearly optimistic for the future mainly driven by this business area. AAK Louisville AAK Louisville has started to contribute to the Group result according to plan.

This should be compared to a 10% increase in lending, which reflects the competition in the sector. Interest income was also affected by the falling interest rate level which will show a further impact in the second quarter of 2015. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange income amounted to net DKK 66 million in the first quarter of 2015 against net DKK 59 million in 2014, an increase of 11%. The reason for the increase is record- breaking remortgaging activity which has continued into 2015. The total core income in the first quarter of the year increased from DKK 234 million in 2014 to DKK 238 million in 2015. The increase should be viewed in the context of the fact that the total core income was affected positively by an extraordinary once-only income of the order of DKK 10 million in the first quarter of 2014 in connection with the sale of the bank’s shares in Nets. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciations for tangible assets in the first quarter of 2015 amounted to DKK 70 million against DKK 67 million last year, an increase of 4%, which is thus in keeping with the budget for the quarter. The rate of costs was computed at 29.5, still the lowest in the country. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods with keen competition and unstable economic conditions as this provides a high level of robustness in the bank’s results. Impairment charges for loans Impairment charges for loans of DKK 15 million for the quarter remain unchanged relative to 2014 and are now equivalent to 0.3% p.a. of the total average loans, impairment charges, guarantees and provisions against 0.4% p.a. in the first quarter of 2014. The bank’s total account for impairment charges and provisions amounted to DKK 947 million at the end of the quarter, equivalent to 5.0% of total loans and guarantees. Actual losses and write-offs on loans etc. continue to be very low, and they were exceeded during the quarter by the items “Interest on the impaired part of loans” and “Receivables previously written off”, such that the total account for impairment charges and provisions increased by net DKK 16 million during the first quarter of the year. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounts to DKK 58 million, equivalent to 0.3% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the quarter. As a result of the expectations for a slight economic improvement, total impairment charges in 2015 are expected to show a falling trend relative to 2014.Page 3 of 23 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4913 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Core earnings (Million DKK) 1st qtr. 2015 1st qtr. 2014 2014 2013 2012 2011 Total core income 238 234 907 844 823 767 Total costs and depreciations -70 -67 -298 -273 -265 -248 Core earnings before impairments 168 167 609 571 558 519 Impairment charges for loans etc. -15 -15 -87 -120 -157 -129 Core earnings 153 152 522 451 401 390 Core earnings were DKK 153 million against last year’s DKK 152 million. The realised earnings are above budget for the quarter. Result for portfolio and market risk The portfolio income for the first quarter of 2015 was positive by DKK 23 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the quarter amounted to DKK 301 million, DKK 52 million of which was in listed shares etc., while DKK 249 million was in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio amounted to DKK 3,581 million, and the majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds and short-term bank bonds issued by rated counterparties. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the profit of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 2.4% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital after deduction at the end of the quarter. The bank’s total market risk within exposures to interest rate risk, listed shares and foreign currency remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a value-at-risk model (com- puted with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) in the first quarter of 2015was as follows: Risk in DKK million Risk relative to equity end of 1st quarter 2015 in % Highest risk of loss: 23.3 0.76% Lowest risk of loss: 5.2 0.17% Average risk of loss: 14.6 0.47% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level. Profit after tax The profit after tax was DKK 137 million for the first quarter of 2015 against DKK 136 million last year. The profit after tax is equivalent to a return on equity at the beginning of the year of 18% p.a. after payment of dividend. Balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet at the end of the quarter stood at DKK 21,098 million against last year’s DKK 19,713 million.Page 4 of 23 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4913 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Deposits increased by 12% from DKK 13,775 million at the end of March 2014 to DKK 15,430 mil- lion at the end of March 2015. The bank’s loans increased by 10% from DKK 13,961 million at the end of March 2014 to DKK 15,378 million at the end of March 2015. The loans figure for 2015 includes reverse transactions to a total of DKK 629 million, and the increase in the bank’s loans excluding these transactions was 6% relative to the end of March 2014. The growth in the bank’s loans is broadly based on sectors with good underlying growth in new cus- tomers from both the branch network and the bank’s niche concepts. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the quarter was DKK 2,660 million against DKK 1,896 million at the end of March 2014 and DKK 2,218 million at the end of 2014. The portfolio of guarantees was thus still extraordinarily high as a result of a high level of activity within conversions. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, and the excess liquidity relative to the statutory requirement for liquidity is 147%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to DKK 1.1 billion, balanced by DKK 4.7 billion in short-term money market placings, primarily in Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. The bank’s deposits excluding repo transactions were DKK 536 million greater than loans at the end of the quarter excluding reverse transactions, and the bank’s loans portfolio is more than fully financed by deposits and the bank’s equity. In addition, a part of the loans portfolio for wind turbines in Germa- ny is refinanced back-to-back with KfW Bankengruppe, and the DKK 1,045 million concerned can thus be disregarded in terms of liquidity. The bank requires no financing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must al- ways be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. New liquidity regulations will come into force with effect from 1 October 2015, viz. the so-called LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) key figure. The key figure will show the ability of banks to honour their payment obligations for a 30-day period without access to market funds, and the key figure will subse- quently replace the current Section 152 liquidity key figure. The key figure is computed as the propor- tion of the bank’s cash and cash equivalents / liquid assets to its payment obligations for the next 30 days as computed in accordance with specific rules. Non SIFI banks must have a cover of minimum 60% on 1 October 2015, gradually increasing by 10% on 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2017 and by 20% on 1 January 2018 such that the key figure must be minimum 100% on 1 January 2018. SIFI banks must have a cover of 100% as early as 1 October 2015. Ringkjøbing Landbobank wishes to follow the rules applying to SIFI banks and it is thus the bank’s target that the LCR key figure should be 100% on 1 October 2015. On 31 March 2015 the bank’s LCR key figure was 159% and the bank thus already met the target at the end of the quarter.

The bank’s loans increased by 32%, while deposits increased by 24%. Earnings from the bank’s targeted initiatives within securities trading and asset management have developed very satisfactorily, and the level of ac- tivity has been extraordinarily high because of the substantial wave of conversions of mortgage credit loans in the first quarter of 2005. Notwithstanding the bank’s high core capital of 13.6%, the pre-tax return on the bank’s capital and reserves was 27% p.a., which is considered highly satisfactory by the bank’s management. Net income from interest and fees The earnings on net income from interest and fees was DKK 121 million against DKK 103 million in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 17%. The increasing business, particularly the highly positive growth in the number of customers and the continuing increase in deposits and loans, was responsible for the 10% increase in earnings on net in- come from interest, as the interest margin was much lower in the first quarter of 2005 relative to last year, which is attributable partly to increasing competition but especially to an altered product mix. Fees and commissions amounted to net DKK 33 million in 2005 against DKK 23 million in 2004. The positive increase is partly attributable to the bank’s activities within securities trading and asset man- agement and partly to the very large number of conversions of mortgage credit loans in the first quarter on 2005. Securities and foreign exchange income Value adjustments of securities and exchange rate adjustments etc. showed a gain of DKK 13.4 million against last year’s DKK 12.0 million. The gains were DKK 3.5 million on listed shares, a gain of DKK 3.2 million on interest-bearing debts, and a positive exchange rate adjustment of DKK 1.5 million. A positive value adjustment of DKK 5.2 million was also made to fixed-asset shares. The portfolio of shares etc. amounted to DKK 228 million at the end of the quarter, DKK 102 million of which was in listed shares with DKK 126 million in fixed-asset shares etc. The bond portfolio amounted to DKK 506 million with a corrected interest risk of 1.2% of capital and reserves. Costs Total costs including depreciation on tangible assets amounted to DKK 46 million against last year’s DKK 42 million, an increase of 8.8 %. The rate of costs was computed at 37.3%, which is a 7.2% improvement relative to the first quarter of 2004, when the figure was 40.2%. The rate of costs was computed without including the positive value adjustment of fixed-asset shares. In the first quarter of 2005 the bank had an average of 241 full-time employees against 228 in the first quarter of 2004.

The level of write-downs on loans is judged to be highly satisfac- tory, and it is not expected to change significantly during the rest of the year. The quality of the bank’s portfolio of loans and guarantees is good. The bank’s total provisions stood at DKK 369 million at the end of the quarter after reverse entry of DKK 40.5 million in provisions on 1 January 2005 in connection with the introduction of the new accounting rules. The percentage of provisions is 3.0% of total loans, provisions and guarantees, and the loan portfolio with zeroed interest is DKK 20 million.

Result after tax The result after tax was DKK 60 million after tax of DKK 23 million. The result is equivalent to a 19% return on capital and reserves at the beginning of the period after deduction of dividend etc. The balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet stood at DKK 10,305 million at the end of the quarter against last year’s DKK 8,345 million, an increase of 23%. Deposits increased by 24% and amount to DKK 5,692 mil- lion. Loans increased by 32% and amount to DKK 7,676 million. The guarantee portfolio was DKK 4,139 million at the end of the quarter against last year’s DKK 3,165 million. DKK 1,257 million of the guarantee portfolio covers foreign loans. Capital in 2005 Capital and reserves at the end of 2004 stood at DKK 1,237 million after deduction of dividend etc. The total effect of the altered accounting rules has not influenced the capital and reserves, which amounted to DKK 1,298 million after addition of the result for the quarter after tax. The bank was authorised by the general meeting in February 2005 to buy up to 60,000 shares (at mar- ket price, but maximum DKK 2,050 per share) in order to reserve them for subsequent cancellation. No shares had been allocated for subsequent cancellation as of 19 April 2005. The bank took up hybrid Tier 1 capital at the beginning of March 2005 to the value of DKK 200 mil- lion with an indefinite term. The amount is included in the bank’s capital as Tier 1 capital on an equal footing with the capital and reserves.

The core capital ratio (Tier 1) is computed at 13.6% including the result for the period and 13.0% without the result for the period. The Tier 1 capital ratio including the result for the period but excluding hybrid capital is 11.9%. The bank’s shares were listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange at 2,163 at the beginning of the year. The price at the end of the quarter was 2,332, an increase of 8% excluding the dividend of DKK 100 per share which was paid. Accounting policies Following a new accounting regulation from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority containing accounting rules adapted to the international IAS and IFRS rules, the bank adopted new rules on 1 January 2005. In accordance with the new rules, accounting policies were changed accordingly relative to previous years. Under the new accounting regulation, the layout of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet has changed to some extent, including changes in the designation of certain items, and certain items in the balance sheet relative to previous usage have been split, added or deleted. Reference is made to the bank’s announcement of the annual accounts of 2 February 2005 and the an- nual report for 2004 with respect to the changes in accounting policies and the effect on capital and reserves as of 1 January 2005 (the herein mentioned monetary effects have not subsequent changed). The most important changes in policies etc. are described below. Finally, the amended accounting policies will appear in the bank’s annual report for 2005. With respect to loans and other debts, the new accounting regulation also requires that establishment fees etc. which are comparable to ongoing interest payments must be accrued over the life of the loan so that the item “Loans and other debtors” is estimated in future at amortized cost price. The accounting regulation also requires that in future, there must be an objective indication of impair- ment for a provision to be made – designated under the new rules as write-downs on loans and other debtors. Systems of provisions have been established in the area of private customers which are based on ratings of the bank’s customers, while individual assessments of all clients are made in the business area. In future, buildings and land will be split into the items “Investment properties” and “Domiciles”. In- vestment properties are to be valued at market value computed on the basis of a yield-based model, while domiciles are to be estimated at reassessed values computed as market value on the date of reas- sessment on the basis of a yield-based model less subsequent cumulative depreciation. It should be noted that as of 1 January 2005, there has been a change in the bank’s estimating of scrap values for accounting purposes with respect to the bank’s domiciles. With respect to other tangible fixed assets (operating equipment etc.), there has also been a change in the estimation of the life of operating equipment etc. so that in future, the items will be depreciated over an expected life of five years. These changes in estimates have meant an improvement of approx. DKK 0.5 million before tax in the result for the first quarter of 2005.

INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB | Interim Report January - March 2016 | Q1 “Deliveries to the United Kingdom and Australia started during the quarter as planned. Sales reached SEK 79.5 million, a 39 per cent increase compared with the same period in the previous year.” Lars Højgård Hansen, CEO IMPORTANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER • INVISIO received two follow-up orders from the Australian Department of Defence worth about SEK 13 million and SEK 15 million. Delivery is planned to take place successively in 2016, starting in the second quarter. • INVISIO received an order worth about SEK 20 million to equip French security forces during the Euro 2016 soccer championship. Delivery will be in the second quarter. • At the close of the quarter the order book was SEK 137.0 million (42.9).

In the first quarter sales reached SEK 79.5 million, a 39 per cent increase compared with the same period in the previous year. This, together with our scalable business model of outsourced production means that the operating profit grew by 65 per cent to SEK 23.5 million. The operating margin was 29.6 per cent. The order book was SEK 137 million at the close of the quarter. Deliveries started to United Kingdom and Australia Our products and expertise will form an important part of the modernization programs of several leading defense forces in the next few years. Last autumn we won the contract for the THPS program in the United Kingdom and received a first follow-up order worth SEK 130 million. The deliveries of this order started according to plan during the quarter and are expected to be completed before the end of the year. The equipment is now ready to be used by the customer, after rapid project implementation by our local partner. We will also gradually supply our systems to army units in Australia. The first order for the LAND 125 program was delivered during the quarter and at the same time we received two follow-up orders of SEK 13 million and SEK 15 million. Starting in the second quarter we will start to deliver these orders as well. Orders from special forces in new countries Through good knowledge of the industry and long-term commitments in the defense sector we have continued to create interest in our communication solutions during the quarter. Both military special forces and armies need more effective, durable and easily used solutions that contribute to increased flexibility and personal safety. The reasons are technical and operative as well as economic and health- related. In March we received an order from French security forces worth about SEK 20 million. The equipment will be used during this summer's Euro 2016 soccer championship, which has had extensive media coverage. Apart from the benefits of protecting their hearing and being able to communicate with their team, wearers will be able to hear clearly where sound is coming from and what is going on around them. During the quarter we have also received smaller orders from special forces in both defense and police services in a number of new countries in Europe, including the Benelux region. Our communication solutions are interesting for special forces, which, unlike armies and modernization programs, often have less extensive and thus shorter decision-making and purchasing processes. Initiatives for continued growth Our focus in 2016 is on continued business expansion. At the end of 2015 we started a well-considered increase in innovation and development capacity through a number of new recruitments, an initiative that continued in the first quarter. The augmented resources in research and development are aimed at strengthening and Sales (SEK m) EBIT (SEK m) ” During the quarter we have also received smaller orders from special forces in both defense and police services in a number of new countries in Europe, including the Benelux region.” 0 50 100 150 200 250 2012 2013 2014 2015 Jan-Mar 2016 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 2012 2013 2014 2015 Jan-Mar 2016INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB | Interim Report January - March 2016 | 3 Q1 broadening the company's product portfolio and thus laying the foundation for further increases in sales to existing customer categories. We have also started investing in both existing and new geographical markets, through intensifying our presence in selected countries in Asia, the Middle East and South America, where we assess that long-term business opportunities exist for our products. Together, these investments create conditions for continued positive development for INVISIO. Lars Højgård Hansen, CEO The augmented resources in research and development are aimed at strengthening and broadening the company's product portfolio and thus laying the foundation for further increases in sales to existing customer categories.INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB | Interim Report January - March 2016 | 4 Q1 INVISIO in brief INVISIO develops and sells cutting-edge personal communication and hearing protection systems that enable users to operate and communicate safely and clearly in all environments, even in tough conditions such as loud noise, heat or under water. Innovative solutions INVISIO's systems consist of advanced headsets and control units that interface to a wide range of other communication devices, for example two-way radio and intercom systems in vehicles. The ability to combine expertise in human hearing, acoustics, electronics and mechanics makes the company’s products unique. Military modernization drives growth The company’s customers are mainly found in the government sector but also in the commercial sector. For example, military special forces and armies need more effective, durable and easily used solutions that contribute to increased flexibility and personal safety. The motives are both technical/operative and economic and health-related. Sales are primarily via a global network of partners and resellers but in some markets the company sells directly to end customers. Many countries' defense forces are carrying out modernization programs, called Future Soldier Programs, where existing equipment is upgraded or replaced with more modern equipment. The programs that include radio and communication solutions requiring in-ear-headsets and hearing protection constitute important business opportunities for INVISIO. In 2013-2015 INVISIO achieved a market leader position by winning long-term contracts in Denmark, the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia. Uneven order flow and sales over the year INVISIO's market is characterized by large procurements often with long lead times due to extensive processes with customer tests both in laboratories and among end users. This means that the order intake and sales for individual quarters may vary and have an effect on the full year figures. Financial targets Sales for 2015 were SEK 230 million. The sales target is to increase sales by an average of at least 20 per cent per year. The operating margin should not fall below 15 per cent. To achieve the targets continued growth with good cost control is necessary. The company focuses on the following four areas: Increasing market share, geographical expansion, product development and cost control.

The terminal is designed as a volume terminal, primarily intended for industrial volume goods. Such goods generally do not require fully temperature controlled spaces. Taking the normal bulky volume and nature of the envisaged goods into account, the premises need not be equipped with any complex fixtures or enhanced theft protection. Instead, the terminal is cost-efficient and optimised for its specific purpose. The premises are designed for efficient short-term storage, and fixtures and equipment are designed to facilitate the handling of the volume goods that often arrive at and leave the terminal on the same day. The transport-efficient location alongside the container terminal on the rail line also increases its attractiveness to companies, such as Van Dieren Logistics, one of the tenants, with its regular deliveries from southern Europe. The company also appreciates the flexibility that Catena is able to offer, because Van Dieren Logistics is likely to need increased space as its operations develop. The property has also been equipped with the concept facade that Catena intends to introduce at the logistics facilities it operates as those properties are developed. The terminal, which was only built after an initial contract for a part of the property had been signed with Van Dieren Logistics, was completed in the spring of 2016. The newly built terminal is in line with Catena’s increased focus on industrial development of premises adapted to specific logistics tasks. The terminal is located within a 75,000 square-metre area of land included in Catena’s portfolio of developable land in strategic logistics locations in southern and central Sweden.

Industrial development of a new terminal in KatrineholmCEO’s review 3Catena AB Interim report January-March 2016 Being twice the size, Catena generates opportunities The integration of recently acquired Tribona is progressing according to plan. Following the merger, the floor space of our property portfolio increased from slightly more than 0.8 million square metres to 1.5 million. Our property value has risen from just over SEK 5 billion to just over SEK 10 billion. The number of employees has increased from 25 to 34 and we now divide the operations into five regions rather than the previous three, in order to be closer to our customers and properties. Despite Tribona not having been consolidated until 26 January, and non-recurring expenses and reclassifications having affected the income statement in the amount of about SEK 20 million, the new merged Catena can report improved profit from property management compared with the first quarter of 2015. Profit from property manage- ment has also been affected by the lower letting ratio in the “Tribona portfolio”. In addition, interest expenses were somewhat higher than normal, due to acquisition loans. Combined, these factors mean that the income statement does not provide a fair reflection of the operations. However, thanks to the doubling of our portfolio, we note strong growth in the net operating surplus, which amounted to SEK 127 million for the quarter, compared with SEK 86 million for the corresponding period in 2015. Like our sector colleagues, our income statement is affected by the change in the value of the derivative portfolio. The change in value, of a negative SEK 73 million, is a consequence of lower long-term interest rates over the quarter. This does not affect our cash flow however. With regard to new construction, DHL has moved into its new terminal in Malmö. Our first volume terminal in Katrineholm has just been completed and the final inspection has been made. We are in progress with the first phase of a 14,000 square-metre warehouse at our e-commerce cluster in Ängelholm. We have also completed procurement of contracting services and are about to commence construction on the second phase, comprising a 43,000 square-metre warehouse for e-commerce company Boozt. In April, we also commence construction of our second volume terminal directly adjacent to the container terminal in Nässjö. After the past year’s successful leasing efforts, resulting in most of our properties being leased, following the merger, we again find ourselves in a situation with relatively high vacancies. Based on the existing balance sheet, I consider this a great opportunity to increase income and cut expenses on leasing, since the tenant then assumes the operating expenses for heating. Initially, our vacancies amount to slightly more than 220,000 square metres. Thanks to strong demand, we dare maintain our ambition of halving this by next summer.Accordingly, the task for the year can, in all simplicity, be expressed as follows: “Leasing and continued active work on the balance sheet.” Among other things, the latter entails continued work on refinancing the “Tribona portfolio”. But also divesting older, obsolete, low-yield units, such as the one we just sold in Partille, and replacing them with new, modern, energy-efficient logistics properties.

Income from contracts with terms of more than three years accounted for approximately 59 percent of Catena’s contracted annual rent, which entails stable income with no appreciable variation between periods, except in connection with acquisitions and sales. The average remaining lease period is approximately 5 years.

Financial expenses Financial expenses amounted to SEK 54.6 million (24.1) and the increase is an effect of the acquisition of Tribona. As a consequence of the acquisition, average interest on borrowings, which have now increased overall, rose by 1 percentage point, resulting in higher interest expenses. Financial expenses also include non-recurring items of approximately SEK 2 million, incurred as a consequence of the acquisition. Earnings Despite being burdened by substantial non-recurring amounts, profit from property management rose by 2 percent to SEK 56.9 million (55.9). The expenses of approximately SEK 20 million comprise a large number of individual items, the largest of which is the reassessment of the year’s opening holding in Tribona, which, in connection with the preparation of the acquisition analysis for the now wholly owned holding, resulted in an expense of SEK 12 million being recognised under Participations in profit of associated companies. Profit for the period decreased by SEK 28.5 million to SEK 39.9 million, primarily attributable to the decline in the value of derivatives due to long-term market rates having fallen over the period. This negative change in value was partly offset by a positive change in the value of investment properties. The unrealised changes in value are of an accounting nature and do not affect cash flow. The positive deferred tax is largely an effect of the tax-free company disposal of the Preppen HB property (Högsbo 21: 2).

The inspection process was satisfactory and it was concluded just before Easter. The inspection meant early clarification of several items and the bank already has a total overview. The full first-quarter report is thus finalised and approved by the bank’s management today. Publication has thus been brought forward compared to the financial calendar for 2018 which was announced earlier. Please do not hesitate to contact the bank’s management if you have any questions.

No. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.dk Management’s review Core income Net interest income was DKK 167 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to DKK 161 million in 2017, an increase of 4%. The bank is satisfied with this development, but it should also be compared to a 10% increase in lending volumes, which underlines that interest income is still influenced by a changed mix of loans with more low-margin and low-risk products. This item is also still influenced by the competition in the sector and continuing low interest rates. Fee,commission and foreign exchange income amounted to DKK 85 million net in the first quarter of 2018 compared to DKK 71 million net in 2017, an increase of 19%.Fee income in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily affected positively by an increase in income from securities trading, asset management and custody accounts and from guarantee commission and mortgage credit commission. Earnings from sector shares increased by DKK 4 million to DKK 21 million in the first quarter of 2018. The earnings derive primarily from return on the bank’s ownership interests in DLR Kredit and BankInvest Holding (BI Holding). In March 2018, the board of directors of BI Holding, in which the bank had an ownership interest of 10.3% at the end of March 2018, decided to change the valuation principles for the company’s shares. The change in the valuation principles resulted in a revaluation of the bank’s ownership interest by DKK 52 million. Although the revaluation can be related to a sector share, it has been booked in the bank’s statement of core earnings under the item “Result for the portfolio” because it is a once-only income that does not influence the bank’s regular income from its holding of sector shares. Total core income in the first quarter increased by 9% from DKK 251 million in 2017 to DKK 274 million in 2018. Costs and depreciation Total costs including depreciation and write-downs on tangible assets amounted to DKK 83 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to DKK 75 million last year, an increase of 11%. The increase compared to the first quarter of 2018 is related to a DKK 3 million increase in staff costs and a DKK 5 million non-recurrent write-down on property. The rate of costs was unchanged relative to the 2017 level and was computed at 30.3 for the first quarter of 2018, which continues to be the lowest in Denmark. The bank expects total costs to increase by 3-5% for the year as a whole including the above write- down on property.Page 4 of 29 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • 6950 Ringkøbing • Tel.

No. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.dk Impairment charges for loans The bank reversed impairment charges during the first quarter of the year, and a total of DKK 26 million was thus carried to income during the quarter compared to an expense of DKK 5 million in 2017. The reversals were made on the basis of improved credit quality in certain exposures, and as a whole there were no new impairment charges during the quarter. With effect from 1 January, the bank started using impairment rules that are compatible with the IFRS 9 reporting standard. The IFRS 9 rules are incorporated into the Danish Executive Order on Financial Reports for Credit Institutions and Investment Firms etc. and with the introduction of IFRS 9, the previous impairment model, which was an incurred loss model, has been replaced by an expected loss model. The new expected loss model means that, on initial recognition, a financial asset must be impaired by the expected credit loss for a twelve-month period (stage 1). If the credit risk for the asset subsequently increases significantly relative to initial recognition, the asset must be impaired by the expected credit loss over the asset’s remaining life (stage 2). Impairment charges for exposures at stages 1 and 2 are calculated on the basis of a statistical model. If there is objective evidence of impairment (stage 3), the asset must be impaired by the expected credit loss over the asset’s remaining life, but interest income must be recognised in the income statement based on the effective interest method applied to the impaired amount. The IFRS 9 rules resulted in additional impairment charges of DKK 59 million at the beginning of 2018; the effect on the bank’s equity after tax at the beginning of the period is thus DKK 46 million, equivalent to 1.2% of equity. Further reference is made to the section “Capital structure”. Individual impairment charges (stage 3) were DKK 558 million at the end of the quarter, while stages 1 and 2 impairment charges totalled DKK 371 million on 31 March 2018. The bank’s total account for impairment charges and provisions was DKK 971 million at the end of the quarter, equivalent to 4.0% of total loans and guarantees. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounted to DKK 22 million, equivalent to 0.1% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the quarter. On the basis of the quality of the bank’s loans portfolio and prospects for economic development, the bank still expects total impairment charges in the coming quarters to remain low.

Operating profit per kilo continued to improve, from SEK 0.59 to SEK 0.60 due to a higher proportion of value added products.  A record high operating profit for the first quarter for the largest business area, Food Ingredients, reached SEK 137 million (104), an increase of 32 percent. In the first quarter the business area reported significant volume growth of 12 percent. Continued increases in volumes of high-value products and a consequently more profitable product mix enhanced the result. The integration of the acquired Golden Foods/Golden Brands (now AAK Louisville) continue to develop according to plan.  The business area Chocolate & Confectionery Fats’ operating result reached SEK 81 million (81) and remained stable as earlier predicted.  The smallest business area, Technical Products & Feed continued to experience challenging markets conditions. The underlying trend in the first quarter 2012 was still very challenging but slightly less challenging than during the third and fourth quarter 2011.  We also recorded, as predicted, a record high first quarter cash flow of SEK 384 million.  Earnings per share increased, from SEK 3.38 to SEK 3.43 despite higher interest costs. Concluding remarks: “The impact on our industry from the more difficult general economy in Europe is difficult to predict. However, based on AAK’s customer value propositions for health and reduced costs, customer product co-development and solutions approach, and the AAK Acceleration program (Growth-Efficiency-People), we remain prudently optimistic for the future mainly driven by a very strong Food Ingredients business,” says CEO and President Arne Frank.AarhusKarlshamn AB Phone +46 40 627 8300 info@aak.com 556669-2850 Jungmansgatgan 12 Fax +46 40 627 83 11 www.aak.com SE5566692850001 SE-211 19 Malmö Registered office: Malmö SWEDEN The Interim report for the first quarter 2012 will be presented today, 3 May 2012 at 1 pm CET at a telephone conference.
