In Stockholm, DHL leases a terminal on the Drivremmen 1 property from Catena. Today, the terminal, which Catena acquired from DHL in late 2016, is a state of the art facility. The project managers for DHL are Björn Rönning and Sara Dawidson. Both work within the DHL’s property staff unit that safeguards optimal functionality at all of the company’s logistics facilities. Sara Dawidson explains: “Drivremmen 1 is a terminal specialised in reloading and distributing all types of goods, except frozen and refrigerated ones. We receive goods 24 hours a day, six days a week at the terminal. These are goods on pallets that, kept whole or broken down into smaller packages, are reloaded onto smaller vehicles that can more easily navigate Stockholm’s narrow city-centre streets, or that are forwarded to other DHL facilities. This imposes a number of demands on a modern terminal.” Location that minimises transport “The location must allow all addresses in the area served by the terminal to be reached with the shortest possible transport distances. It should also be adjacent to a trunk road junction, allowing the terminal to be accessed easily by the larger trailers arriving from the entire Nordic region around the clock. It should be located in an area without housing, so that operation can continue around the clock without disturbing the neighbours’ sleep. Drivremmen’s location at one of Stockholm’s entry points meets these criteria well.” Designed for efficient goods handling “Another key requirement is the facility’s design, based on several large vehicles carrying arriving goods being able to offload at the same time. This demands space and a large number of loading bays. Equally important is the terminal’s capacity for smaller vehicles, including delivery vans. They should easily be able to load the goods to be delivered to stores or directly to consumers. In addition, a modern terminal must be designed to facilitate marshalling and reloading of the goods being handled while minimising internal transport. DHL applies well-proven models for optimal goods handling, meaning that the Drivremmen terminal meets DHL’s stringent requirements on logistics efficiency.” Energy efficiency that spares the environment and cuts costs “We also have a clear responsibility for sustainability within DHL,” Sara Dawidson continues. “That imposes considerable demands, both on the facilities we operate ourselves and the ones we lease. Drivremmen meets these requirements well. DHL has itself made major investments in the facility to save energy. The facility is heated with a geothermal heating system and has additional insulation to minimize heat losses. The ventilation has been improved and all lighting has been replaced with modern LED technology. That has improved not only the facility’s environmental efficiency, but also its cost-efficiency.” Improvement continues Catena’s Tobias Karlsson, who manages the property, sums up the situation: “At Drivremmen, we have developed a modern and, in all respects, efficient facility at a strategically important address in Västberga, on the outskirts of Stockholm. This development was initiated by DHL but continued by Catena following its acquisition of the property. Today, the terminal of just over 33,000 square metres, which was built as a Green Building facility, is fully leased to DHL. We are now continuing to improve the property. The agenda includes replacing switches to correctly and safely safeguard power supply and reduce power consumption. New lifts were installed too, also contributing to comfort on the property. The upgrading of the dining room and changing rooms also contributes, perhaps to an even greater extent,” concludes Tobias Karlsson. Energy efficient premises for DHL’s city logistics 2 INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2018 CATENA ABStrong earnings with continued prioritisation of project development Profit from property management has risen by 25 percent and our project portfolio has never been larger. Catena has both the capacity and the expertise to continue strengthening our position through further investments. In accordance with our intentions, we have increased our rental income compared with the second quarter of 2017, largely due to acquisitions and increased net letting. Regardless of whether new production or acquired properties are involved, the objective is to always be present in the country’s most important logistics locations. We also offer properties that in earnest match the needs that are appearing as consumption patterns and goods flows shift. This has, for example, resulted in an advanced position in digitally driven trade and our having positioned ourselves early in city logistics where more frequent retail deliveries and food deliveries to consumers and restaurants are imposing new demands on sustainable logistics and infrastructure in urban areas. Profit from property management, which basically represents our cash flow before changes in working capital, amounted to 52 percent of our rental income – an outcome that is entirely in line with our stated ambitions for the period. Continued project development During the first quarter, the Mappen 1 property in Linköping was acquired, adjacent to our existing facilities in the area, where new construction is also in progress. On the whole, this provides economies of scale and we see great potential for a major FMCG cluster in Linköping. Outside Malmö, an agreement was signed with DS Smith and Lekia regarding our fourth facility in the Sunnanå logistics location. The facility at Sunnanå is a multi-tenant warehouse of more than 36,000 square metres in two buildings, adapted to accommo- date more tenants, some of whom will have premises needs that vary over time. We are also investing SEK 107 million in Tahe 1:64, an existing logistics property in Jönköping, after signing a new lease contract with Procurator. Large parts of the property are being remodelled and extended. Completed, the property will have 41,800 square metres of space, most of which has already been leased. Our ambition is to develop additional facilities on an ongoing basis and we have a number of projects that are ready for tenants to move into during the year. Catena has never had such a large project portfolio (SEK 1,337 million) as it does now – and our remaining investment volume in new and existing buildings exceeds SEK 760 million. In particular, the portfolio is growing in digital commerce, city logistics and food distribution, providing confirmation that we are able to meet the new needs that are emerging, attracting industries and businesses with a high rate of change and strong growth. Expertise and capacity for continued growth Good market awareness and new trade patterns are important success factors. For our continued expansion, we also have access to more than 1,700,000 square metres of developable land in strategic locations, and our balance sheet is being further strengthened by ongoing cash flows driven by stable surplus levels and cost-efficient financing. During the quarter, a commercial paper programme was established. This has a framework amount of SEK 2 billion and we have issued commercial papers for SEK 750 million, with maturities of four to nine months and an average interest rate of an attractive 0.39 percent. The programme is covered through backup facilities via property mortgages. Logistics takes its place among respected investments We can now state that logistics properties have become an attractive investment in which there is considerable interest, reflected not least in the trend in Catena’s share price. We receive repeated invitations from the international capital market, and the potential in Sweden is considered particularly high with digitally driven trade not yet having reached its full impact. It is gratifying to see how opportunities in new logistics solutions are being highlighted and play a prominent role. We have worked hard for this over many years, not least through our own inspiration day, Logistics Trends, which attracted a full house in May when arranged for the eighth time. Our knowledge and dedication are paying off. Ultimately, it is the efforts of Catena’s employees that enable us to deliv- er attractive solutions, continuously sharpen our offering and continue to strengthen our position as the leading in logistics property company. Helsingborg, July 2018 Benny Thögersen, CEO 3INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2018 CATENA ABIncome and profit Rental income Rental income in the period increased by 22 percent to SEK 527.5 million (433.6). The increase is mainly due to the acquisition and completion of major projects. Income from contracts with terms of more than three years accounted for approximately 72 percent of Catena’s contractual annual rent, which entails stable income with no appreciable variation between periods, except in connection with acquisitions, completed projects and sales. The average remaining lease period is approximately five years. Duration of leases Duration No. of contracts Contractual annual rent, SEK M Contractual annual rent, % 2018 83 10.5 1 2019 138 174.8 16 2020 77 114.4 11 2021 42 189.5 18 2022 22 88.4 8 2023 23 119.7 11 2024+ 52 380.6 35 Total 437 1,077.9 100 Property expenses Property expenses increased to SEK 130.9 million (103.3) due to a larger property portfolio but also due to increased maintenance of the properties. The cold winter with an unusually high amount of snow also increased costs. There are seasonal variations in the operation and mainte- nance of properties. Winters with much cold and snow entail higher costs for heating and snow removal. A hot summer can mean increased expenses for cooling. These variations, which have the greatest impact during the winter and summer months, are, to some extent, offset by a change in billed expenses to tenants. Financial expenses Financial expenses amounted to SEK 120.1 million in the first half of the year (103.1). The increase in financial expenses is due in part to a larger property portfolio, but is mainly the result of the reorganisation of swaps carried out in the first quarter of 2017, which, in turn, affected financing expenses positively by SEK 16.6 million as a non-recurring effect. The fact that the financial expenses, cleared for the previous year’s reorganisation of swaps, and despite a larger loan volume, remain on the same level as in 2017 demonstrates that Catena’s efforts to lower its interest level have yielded results. Compared with the second quarter of 2017, Catena has lowered its aver- age interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 2.8 percent (3.3). Profit Despite the higher financial expenses, profit from property management increased by 25 percent compared with the previous period, from SEK 54.9 million to SEK 274.2 million. The primary reason for the improved profit from property management is an increased portfolio. The share in the earn- ings of associated companies is significantly higher than in the previous period, mainly due to a value adjustment of the Huddinge Regulatorn 2 property. Profit for the period amounted to SEK 371.2 million, which is SEK 35.0 million higher than in the preceding year. Changes in value of property and goodwill are SEK 33.0 million lower than in the corresponding period in the preceding year, while the change in value of derivatives is SEK 12.2 million lower than in the preceding year. The unrealised changes in value are of an accounting nature and do not affect cash flow. On 14 June, the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) adopted new tax regulations for the business sector. Among other things, the decision entails a two-step reduction in corporation tax to 21.4 percent as of 2019, and to 20.6 percent as of 2021. As a conse- quence of this decision, Catena has made a preliminary revalu- ation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, entailing a non- recurring tax income item of approximately SEK 67 million.

Cash flow from working capital was positive, amounting to SEK 65 million (negative 66). • Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), R12M, was 15.5 percent (15.6 at December 31, 2017). Business areas • Food Ingredients – operating profit improved by 8 percent to SEK 292 million (271). • Chocolate & Confectionery Fats – operating profit reached SEK 169 million (165). • Technical Products & Feed – operating profit improved by 256 percent, reaching SEK 32 million (9). CEO’s comments The positive trend we have seen over the last few years continued during the second quarter. Organic volume growth reached 6 percent (5). Based on our initiatives and by focusing on selected segments and applications in line with our company program The AAK Way, we continue to gain market shares. Year-over-year, operating profit increased by 11 percent to a new all-time high for a second quarter. All three business areas showed volume growth as well as profit growth. In addition, most of our geographic markets have seen good progress. However, there has been a slightly weaker development in the US market during the quarter. Food Ingredients had another strong quarter with Dairy and Special Nutrition leading the way. For the second consecutive quarter our Bakery segment continued to show growth. After a challenging first quarter, Chocolate & Confectionery Fats was back to a small profit growth. This despite being hampered by a stretched utilization of some production lines as well as a planned maintenance stop which will support future volume growth of high-end products. Business area Technical Products & Feed reported strong volume and profit growth in the quarter. The product mix continued to improve within the fatty acids business. Compared to last year we had a shorter maintenance stop and lower raw material prices.AAK AB (publ.)

CEO COMMENTS Troax has developed well during the second quarter with an organic increase in orders of 17%, which clearly is above the historical growth average. We have received several important orders from customers within, automotive, warehouse and property, which shows that the Troax offering is strong. The newly acquired company in the USA, Folding Guard is following their plans and has a favorable trend in orders received. Our judgment is that the market development during the second Quarter has been positive for the Group. The growth has been especially strong in Continental Europe, and also new Markets have had a positive quarter. In the UK, we have during the second quarter seen some negative effects of a weaker willingness to invest at some customer groups, probably caused by the uncertainty related to Brexit etc. The orderbook at the end of the quarter continues on a good level. The integration work of the acquired company (end of last year), Folding Guard is progressing well. During the second quarter, the Nashville warehouse has been closed and the distribution moved to Chicago. The focus on growth continues to be strong but is not expected to show any bigger impacts until 2018/19. We can again confirm that the acquisition has so far been well received by important customers in the US. We see good opportunities to strengthen the customer base, long term, for both brands in the important market of North America. Sales invoiced increased in the quarter by 40 per cent compared with the same period last year (excluding acquisition and currency the increase is 26 per cent). The progress was positive in all markets. Totally, the Group has increased to an order intake level of approximately 138 MEUR on a rolling 12 month basis (including Folding Guard for the first two quarters of 2017). The result has continued to improve during the quarter, mainly because of good sales volumes and the consequential good capacity utilization in our factories. During last year, we also had some one-time costs related to the inauguration of the new paint line which we do not have this year. The market investments are continuing per plan. This is at a lower level short term, as some internal resources have been dedicated to the integration of our American acquisition. The operating result was 8,2 (5,1) MEUR, which corresponds to a profit margin of 20,7 per cent to be compared with 18,0 per cent last year. It should be noted that the consolidation of Folding Guard decreases the margin in percentage terms. We do however see clear possibilities to increase the margin also for Folding Guard long term. The Net result has also developed in a positive way, and amounts to 3,7 MEUR for the quarter (3,1 MEUR). In this comparison, we must consider that we have had a one-time financing cost of -2,3 MEUR related to the redemption of the bond in order to move over to ordinary bank financing. Barring any other eventualities, this change in the company’s financing structure will improve the finance net by 3,4 MEUR annually from now onwards. The result per share after the first half year is 0,39 EUR to be compared with 0,30 EUR last year. The Working Capital is on a similar level as the previous quarter. Work in Progress is on a continued high level, indicating that some important projects still are under implementation and hence still have not been invoiced. We have continued with good cash generation from operations during the quarter and the net debt is now 66,5 MEUR and the key figure of our interest-bearing loan in comparison with EBITDA is below our target for the Group.

1 Press release Ängelholm 2018-01-08 Cimco Marine AB (publ) launches 150 hp OXE – production of 200 hp OXE is expected to resume in Q2 Cimco Marine AB (publ) will commence production and delivery of the 150 hp OXE diesel outboard engine this week. During the autumn, the company has worked hard to finalise the 150 hp model. The response from our distributors has been positive. Separately, the root cause for the turbo leakage in the 200 hp OXE has been identified. The production of 200 hp OXE is expected to recommence in Q2. – The launch of 150 hp OXE has been well received by our distributors and end customers. Some of our customers are to convert their 200 hp OXE orders to 150 hp OXE. Overall, of course, it is very pleasing that we now have 150 hp OXE in production, whilst planning with the aim for a "new start" and large-scale production of 200 hp OXE by the end of the second quarter of 2018, says Cecilia Anderberg, CEO Cimco Marine AB. There is a very small difference between the 150 hp OXE and 200 hp OXE in top speed, however, a 150 hp engine allows longer usage intervals and is very suitable for governmental application for marine patrolling purposes, fishing fleets, passenger transports and others. The company has orders covering the production forecast until Q2. The root cause for the turbo leakage in the 200 hp OXE has been identified. During certain specific application of the OXE 200 hp, the engine temperatures exceeds the maximum allowable temperatures for the turbo material. To resolve this, an increase in material specification in terms of temperature resistance is required - meaning change of material and with that, new tooling is required. Material specification, design and supply chain setup are all finalised. Tooling has a long lead time and will be completed around the beginning of Q2 with the aim to recommence production of 200 hp OXE by the end of Q2 2018. – Overall, we have not changed the targets for 2018 as we are expecting the 150 hp to be well received by the market. The long-term target remains the same as previously communicated, says Cecilia Anderberg.

This result was equivalent to a 16% return p.a. on equity. Given the costs incurred in connection with the Deposit Guarantee Fund in connection with the collapse of Amagerbanken and Fjordbank Mors, the result is considered highly satisfactory.

Yours sincerely, Ringkjøbing Landbobank Bent Naur John FiskerPage 2 af 20 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Management Report Core income Core income was 4% lower in the first half of 2011 with a decrease from DKK 389 million in 2010 to DKK 375 million. Net interest income decreased by 3% from DKK 300 million to DKK 290 million. The underlying trend in the figures and the intake of new customers is positive, but the item was negatively affected by a lower interest margin and the low interest level. Like the rest of the financial sector, the bank will in- crease its interest rates during the third quarter of 2011. Combined with continued growth in the fig- ures, this is expected to have a positive effect on the net interest income in the coming quarters. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange earnings amounted to net DKK 79 million in the first half of 2011 against net DKK 82 million in 2010, a fall of 4%. The half-year was characterised by relatively low trading and conversion activity and the larger figures therefore did not result in a corresponding increase in income. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciations on tangible assets amounted to DKK 123 million in the half-year, 3% higher than last year. The rate of costs was computed at 32.8, still the lowest in the country. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods of difficult economic conditions as the bank’s results are thus very robust, which is also reflected in the computation of the bank’s individual solvency requirement. Write-downs on loans Write-downs on loans showed a fall of 15% to net DKK 54 million in the half-year against DKK 63 million last year. The write-downs are equivalent to 0.7% of the total average of loans, write-downs, guarantees and provisions. The bank’s customers appear to be coping better with the weak economic conditions than the average in Denmark. The present level of write-downs is considered satisfactory. The bank’s total account for write-downs and provisions amounted to DKK 616 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 4.2% of total loans and guarantees. Actual write-downs on loans (including interest on the account for write-downs) this half-year continue to be low at a mere DKK 4 million, such that the account for write-downs and provisions increased by net DKK 50 million in the first half- year. The portfolio of loans with zeroed interest amounts to DKK 68 million, equivalent to 0.46% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-year. This is at the same level as last year.Page 3 af 20 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Core earnings (million DKK) 1st half 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Total core income 375 758 753 735 696 609 511 417 368 328 Total costs etc. -123 -240 -238 -239 -234 -208 -190 -184 -163 -155 Core earnings before write-downs 252 518 515 496 462 401 321 233 205 173 Write-downs on loans -54 -138 -159 -77 +11 +69 +5 +4 -10 +6 Core earnings 198 380 356 419 473 470 326 237 195 179 Core earnings were DKK 198 million against last year’s DKK 206 million, a decrease of 4%. The real- ised earnings continue to move towards the upper part of the announced DKK 300-400 million range. Result for the portfolio The result for the portfolio for the first half-year was DKK -0.3 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 286 million, DKK 49 million of which was in listed shares etc. while DKK 237 million was in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 2,283 million, and the great majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds and bonds guaranteed by the Danish government. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the result of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 0.2% of the bank’s core capital after deduction at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposure to interest rate risk, exposure in listed shares etc. and for- eign exchange exposure remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) was as follows in the first half of 2011: Risk in DKK million % risk relative to equity at end of half-year Highest risk of loss: 10.6 0.45% Smallest risk of loss: 2.5 0.11% Average risk of loss 5.7 0.24% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level. Result after tax The result after tax was DKK 135 million for the first half of 2011 against DKK 144 million last year. The result after tax is equivalent to a return on equity of 12% p.a. after payment of dividend. The balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet total at the end of the half-year stood at DKK 18,440 million against last year’s DKK 18,544 million. Deposits increased by 11% from DKK 11,194 million to DKK 12,404 million. The bank’s loans increased slightly to DKK 13,131 million. The underlying growth in new customers from the branch network and within the niches Private Banking and wind turbine financing remains good. However, the changed pattern of consumption with a higher savings ratio is generallyPage 4 af 20 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com resulting in greater repayments on the bank’s existing loans portfolio than previously, and part of the growth is therefore consumed by these repayments. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the half-year was DKK 1,044 million against DKK 1,357 million in 2010. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, and the excess liquidity relative to the statutory requirement is 172%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to only DKK 1.5 bil- lion, balanced by DKK 4.6 billion in short-term money market placing, primarily in Danmarks Nation- albank, Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. The bank’s loans portfolio is thus more than fully financed by deposits and the bank’s equity. In addi- tion, part of the German loans portfolio for wind turbines was refinanced back-to-back with KFW Bankengruppe, and the DKK 853 million in question can thus be disregarded in terms of liquidity. The bank requires no financing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must always be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. The deposit guarantee scheme Ringkjøbing Landbobank has a liability to the mandatory deposit guarantee scheme in Denmark in connection with Amagerbanken’s collapse in February 2011 and Fjordbank Mors’s collapse in June 2011. The bank’s share of these losses is 0.6%. With the most recently announced dividend rate, Am- agerbanken has cost the bank DKK 11.9 million while Fjordbank Mors has cost DKK 8.2 million. The bank has previously overprovided by DKK 1.5 million, and the total expense in the first half-year was thus computed at DKK 18.6 million. Capital The bank’s equity at the beginning of 2011 was DKK 2,312 million, to which must be added the profit for the period and from which must be deducted the dividend paid and the shares purchased, after which the equity at the end of the first half of 2011 was DKK 2,360 million. The bank’s holding of own shares at the end of the half-year was 50,202, equivalent to 1.0 % of the share capital. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio (Tier 2) was computed at 20.2 at the end of the first half of 2011. The core capital ratio (Tier 1) was computed at 18.7.

The restructuring programme, launched in June, is under way and the effects are starting to show through. The annual cost saving from the programme as a whole is calculated at SEK 45 million, with full impact emerging inside two years. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 162.4 million and operating margin was 9.2 percent (8.3) . The market The second quarter is normally our strongest period of the year. The market as a whole moved in a positive direction in the quarter. The Nordic market remains buoyant, as do several markets in Western Europe. The USA continued to perform strongly, partly under the influence of a stronger USD. For the first time in a good while Region Eastern Europe reported stabilized sales. Most notably, the decline in Russia has been slowed. In the Other markets region, a very slight decline was evident as a result of lower orders in the Middle East compared to the previous year when a large order was delivered. Restructuring programme The restructuring programme is under way in the parts of the Group concerned. The programme is focused on the business area for air conditioning, acquired in recent years, and some loss-making units in various countries. The programme consists of capacity adjustments and review of product ranges. The cost of the programme will rise to in all approximately SEK 45 million, with estimated annual cost savings of SEK 45 million and full impact within two years. The cost thus far totals SEK 11 million, of which SEK 9 million arose in the second quarter. Acquisitions In August, we acquired the Czech group 2VV, a leading maker of industrial and residential air handling units, as well as air curtains. The acquisition creates opportunities for product and manufacturing synergies in our European units. Integration of the company is going ahead on schedule. Also, our acquisition of German air curtain maker TTL has gone ahead in line with expectations. Investments Our investment in a new factory in Turkey will provide us with a larger production facility at lower cost. In Skinnskatteberg in Sweden, a major investment in machinery, intended to improve productivity in sheet metal forming is also nearing completion. Outlook Growth is buoyant in several of our markets, although we would have liked to see stronger growth in parts of Western Europe and recovery in Russia. The actions we have planned to increase profit are in full swing. One of Systemair’s strengths is our global presence. On that basis, we can utilise our resources and our market presence to identify and develop the applications and opportunities that emerge. We will also continue to make acquisitions and invest in production equipment, product development and marketing in order to maintain our growth.

Acquisitions and new operations In August, Systemair acquired the Czech corporate group 2VV, a leading developer and manufacturer of industrial and residential air handling units. The company also manufacture air curtains for commercial applications in the region. The company, which has 189 employees, is based in Pardubice, 120 km east of Prague. In 2015, the company reported sales of around EUR 18 million. In September, Systemair acquired the assets of TTL Tür + Torluftschleier Lufttechnische Geräte GmbH, a German manufacturer of high-quality air curtains for commercial applications. TTL, based in Winterbach, west of Stuttgart, reports sales of around EUR 4 million. In addition to the company’s assets, Systemair also took over 24 employees and TTL’s 4,000 m2 leased factory and office building. If the companies acquired had been consolidated as of 1 May 2016, net sales for the period May through October 2016 would have totalled approximately SEK 3,490.0 million. The operating profit for that period would have totalled approximately SEK 157.1 million.

Cash flow and earnings have increased faster than sales, which means that for the first six months of the year we basically meet our fifteen percent operating margin target. We have expanded our revolving credit facility with SEK 200 million, after the increase the total is SEK 450 million. The number of active acquisition dialogues remains high and we continuously put resources in place to maintain and further develop these dialogues. Vitec's financial position and readiness for future acquisitions are solid, we see good conditions for continued acquisition-based growth. After the period, the Danish company MV Nordic A / S has been acquired. The company has a turnover of approximately DKK 110 million with an EBITDA of approximately DKK 11 million and the acquisition will directly contribute to increasing Vitec's earnings per share. Of the Group's approximately 75 percent recurring revenue, 40 percent emerge from SaaS agreements according to a modern subscription model. Vitec continues to convert towards an increasing share of SaaS agreements in new sales or when existing customers upgrade their products. The customer benefits of the SaaS model are becoming more widely known as digitalization continues. This general trend strengthens our potential in transforming our business model. A clear shift from traditional license sales to subscription of cloud-based products reduces reliance on individual license sales, which increases our long-term ability to control our business. This, together with our people’s capacity to innovate and integrate acquisitions, provides good conditions for long- term development of our business. With the acquisition of well-established companies and a high proportion of recurring revenues, Vitec continues on the path to act in several independent and specialized niches to achieve sustainable profitable growth.

As the chart below shows, we have already now reached almost the entire sales in 2012, SEK 39.3 m compared with SEK 43 m. It is also pleasing that we after the period received two larger orders, a SEK 8.0 m order from the Canadian Department of National Defense for various headsets and communications solutions, and a SEK 7.1 m order from the U.S. Army for a number of units of the communications system INVISIO V60. This shows our growth possibilities and that our world leading products now are established on a number of markets. From this and the numerous customer trials and large offers that we have outstanding, we expect a considerable growth in sales during the year. We hold firm that there are conditions for a profitable 2013 and the coming years, but it is too early to give comments about the expected outcome for 2013. This corresponds with our previous communica- tion, namely that it is very difficult to determine exactly which quarters these orders will possibly come in. Sales may therefore, as in this quarter, vary from quarter to quarter due to long lead times from first contact with customer, to inquiry, to cus- tomer trials, to quotation, firm order and delivery. Sales during the second quarter was somewhat lower than our internal goal but was higher than the sales the second quarter previous year, SEK 12.4 m compared with SEK 11.9 m. POSITIVE CASH FLOW It is also pleasing that the cash flow from the operating activities during the first half year was positive and amounted to SEK 1.7 m, which can be compared with SEK -12.2 m the corresponding period 2012. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NATO-ORDER During the quarter we successfully final delivered the record order from the Armed Forces of a NATO-country that we received last fall. The advanced communications solution INVISIO V60 is now being used out on the field and helps the users to communicate better and clearer than ever, and at the same time protect their hearing. During the quarter we also received a new important NATO-order. The SEK 4.7 m order was from NATO Support Agency for a number of units of the communications systems INVISIO V60 and INVISIO X50. The order is a direct result from our previous deliveries within NATO and is continued proof of our products' high quality and that the communications solutions that we offer the most demanding users in the world are astonishing. It is pleasing that our products are increasingly used by NATO-members and this order is of extra importance since we are in NATO's purchase system – NATO Support Agency is the organisa- tion that supports all of the 28 NATO-countries. During the quarter we also received a SEK 1.3 m order from the Finnish Armed Forces for one of our communications systems. We also received a number of smaller orders that were below SEK 1 m and thus not communicated. INCREASED POTENTIAL IN MILITARY PROGRAMS We have previously highlighted the potential with- in the larger military modernization programs that are active in a number of countries across the world. This is what we call the volume market and includes thousands of users. It is very pleasing that we see new incoming requests from these types of programs. There are currently customer trials of the communications solution INVISIO V60 by a number of potential military customers in different countries, and during the quarter we re- ceived new requests for trials. One trend that we are observing more and more is the demand for hearing protection in communication solutions, which suits INVISIO well as we have world leading technology in the field and a number of very good solutions for this. We see good possibilities for continued sales in connection with this type of programs, but it is as we have said difficult for us to determine when the actual purchasing would take place. BOARD AND MANAGEMENT PURCHASES SHARES INVISIO’s Management and Board purchased during the quarter a total of 227.530 shares in the Company, differently divided among eight persons. This shows our common strong faith in the Com- pany and the possibilities for success. Lars Højgård Hansen CEO Half -year 2013INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL.) | Interim Report January – June 2013 3 Total Income and Result April – June 2013 Total income during the second quarter increased compared with the corresponding period 2012 and amounted to SEK 12.4 m (11.9). Gross profit amounted to SEK 5.5 m (4.6) and the gross margin was 44.7 percent (38.3). It is characteristic that the gross margin may vary from quarter to quarter depending on product mix and on the share of direct sales to end-customers – with higher margins – compared with the share of sales made through distributors. The order book was SEK 11.7 m (5.2) at the end of the quarter. Operating expenses for the second quarter was SEK 12.0 m (10.6). Operating loss for the second quarter thus amounted to SEK -6.4 m (-6.0). Net financial items for the second quarter amounted to SEK -0.4 m (-0.4). Loss after tax for the second quarter amounted to SEK -6.8 m (-6.4). Loss per share for the second quarter amounted to SEK -0.18 (-0.18). Total Income and Result January – June 2013 Total income during the first half of the year increased compared with the corresponding period 2012 and amounted to SEK 39.3 m (18.1). Gross profit amounted to SEK 17.5 m (7.3) and the gross margin was 44.4 percent (40.3). Operating expenses for the first half of the year was SEK 22.3 m (21.2). Operating loss for the first half of the year thus amounted to SEK -4.8 m (-13.9). Net financial items for the first half of the year amounted to SEK -1.0 m (-1.1). Loss after tax for the first half of the year amounted to SEK -5.9 m (-15.0). Loss per share for the first half of the year amounted to SEK -0.15 (-0.44). Capital Expenditure, Cash flow and Liquidity, Financing and Shareholders’ Equity CAPITAL EXPENDITURE During the first half of the year, capital expenditures amounted to SEK -2.5 m (-3.4) of which -2.5 m (-3.3) was activated development costs. CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Cash flow from the operating activities during the first half of the year amounted to SEK 1.7 m (-12.2). Cash flow from the investment activities amounted to SEK -2.5 m (-3.4). Cash flow from the financing activities amounted to SEK -2.1 m (0.6), of which new share issue SEK 0 m (7.6). Cash flow during the period thus amounted to SEK -2.9 m (-15.0). At the end of the period, cash and cash equivalents of the Group amounted to SEK 1.3 m (2.4). Of the Company’s total loans of SEK 29.9 m per last June, SEK 7.2 m concerns factoring. The remaining SEK 22 m concerns three-year loans that are free of amortization during 2013. The Company management and Board continue to work actively and continuously with the Com- pany’s governance and control, including earnings, liquidity and financial position. The Board is also continuously evaluating that the conditions for further operations are fulfilled. It is not possi- ble to exclude the possibility that the Company might need additional capital until the business generates a positive cash flow. The view held by the Company management and Board is the same as previously, namely that necessary liquidity and financing will be generated and added to operations though continuing income, borrowing, and the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting to carry out new issues or such.INVISIO COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL.) | Interim Report January – June 2013 4 FINANCING INVISIO received during the first quarter a loan of SEK 15 m from a leading Swedish commercial bank. The loan currency has been used to pay a previous loan from Alecta of SEK 10 m and a loan of SEK 5 m from Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag. The loan from the bank is free of amortization charges during 2013 and will be amortized with SEK 6 m in 2014 and with SEK 9 m in 2015. Yggdrasil has guaranteed the loan from the bank with SEK 15 m. INVISIO has pledged the secu- rities against Yggdrasil instead of as previously against Alecta and Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag. INVISIO will pay an annual guarantee commission of 3.5 percent to Yggdrasil and the Board of INVISIO has the view that the agreement with Yggdrasil is according to market conditions. INVISIO received during the first quarter a three-year loan of SEK 4.2 million from Almi Företags- partner AB. This loan will require no repayments in 2013. INVISIO has provided securities in form of a pledge of shares in the subsidiary Nextlink IPR AB. Terms of the loan is that the equity ratio of the Group amounts to no less than 10 percent per end of June 2013 and remains so during the term of the loan. Almi has thereafter declined the demand of the equity ratio. After the period, the loan at the bank according to above has increased with SEK 7.5 m until year- end 2013/14. Yggdrasil has pledged securities with the same terms as above. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Group’s reported shareholders’ equity at the end of the period amounted to SEK -7.4 m (3.5), which resulted into a negative equity ratio (9.6 percent). Parent Company Net income for the Parent Company during the first half of the year amounted to SEK 58.000 (30.000). Operating loss amounted to SEK -2.8 m (-3.1). The loss after tax was SEK -3.5 m (-19.0), of which SEK 0 m (15) is attributable to shareholder contribution to the subsidiary. At the end of the period, cash and cash equivalents held by the Parent Company amounted to SEK 0 m (0.3) and shareholders’ equity to SEK 59.2 m (68.5), which resulted into an equity ratio of 71.0 percent (81.5). The Parent Company had 1 employee (1). Accounting Principles This Interim Report for the Group has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The Parent Company's accounts have been prepared in accordance with RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities and the Swedish Annual Ac- counts Act. The accounting principles that are described in the 2012 Annual Report have been applied. Significant Risks and Uncertainties INVISIO’s business and earnings are affected by a number of external and internal factors. A continuous process is conducted to identify all risks and to assess how each respective risk shall be managed. The risks that the Company is mainly exposed to are market-related risks (including legislation and political decisions, global economic situation, competition, technological risks and market acceptance of new products and dependency of suppliers), operational risks (including the ability to manage growth, customers and cooperation agreements, product liability, immaterial rights, dependence on key persons and employees, as well as risks related to financial reporting) and financial risks (including primarily currency risk, financing risks and liquidity risks). In the Company's opinion, no additional significant risks or uncertainties have arisen during the year, apart from those reported in this Interim Report and on the pages 42-44 and 57-58 in the Annual Report for 2012. As noted in the section "Cash Flow and Liquidity", the Company management and Board are working actively and continuously with the Company's governance and control, including earnings, liquidity and financial position. The Board continuously tests that the conditions for continued

INTERIM REPORT JANUARY- JUNE 2015 PROFIT BEFORE TAX UP 80 % SUMMARY FOR JANUARY-JUNE 2015  Net sales SEK 296,1 M (217,6)  Profit before tax SEK 43,8 M (24,3)  Operating margin 16 % (12)  Earnings per share before dilution SEK 5,77 (3,43)  Cash flow from operations SEK 99,4 M (90,5) SUMMARY FOR APRIL-JUNE 2015  Net sales SEK 152,7 M (116,7)  Profit before tax SEK 22,2 M (12,4)  Operating margin 15 % (11)  Earnings per share before dilution SEK 2,83 (1,85)  Cash flow from operations SEK 25,8 M (26,2)  Revolving credit facility of SEK 250 M for acquisitions CEO´S COMMENTS On 30 June, Vitec signed a SEK 250 million credit facility with Nordea that is intended for acquisitions. This runs over a period of four years. In addition, preexisting borrowing from Nordea has been renegotiated so that the repayment rate will now be SEK 25 million per year over the next four years, instead of the previous rate that was closer to SEK 50 million per year. All in all, this will provide additional cash flow of SEK 25 million per year that can be used for investments. Accordingly, Vitec has created the potential for about SEK 350 million of new investments and acquisitions over the course of the four-year period. Vitec's growth is driven by acquisitions. Since 1998 we have acquired about 25 profitable, well-functioning, vertically strongly niched companies with a significant share of recurring revenue. As a result, we have increased our turnover by an average of 20 per cent per year since the year 2000 and our profits have grown an average of over 20 per cent over the course of the same period. We intend to continue growing through acquisitions, and with a Nordic focus we currently have a list of prospects containing about 100 interesting computer software companies, with a total turnover in excess of SEK 4 billion. The conditions for continued acquisitions appear to be good and two new acquisitions, one in Denmark and one in Norway, have taken place following the end of the period. Both will be incorporated into the business area Auto, which will turn over approximately SEK 100 million per year following these transactions. Having purposefully and rigorously applied our business model for several years, aiming for a high proportion of recurring revenue, we can conclude that the transformation continues. Recurring revenue made up 79% (77% same period last year) of the total revenue for the quarter and for the first six-month period the equivalent number was 78% (73). Within the business area Estate Agents, a large package of measures have been implemented resulting in a charge on the quarterly results of approximately SEK 2.6 million. The staff reduction implemented is due to Sweden's biggest chain of real estate agents, Swedbank Fastighetsbyrå AB, informing us of a transfer to a system it has developed in-house. With a clear shift from traditional licensing to a more up-to-date contract model (SaaS), the proportion of revenue that is recurring and the operating margin increase simultaneously. Together with our employees' huge capacity for renewal and integrating acquisitions, this provides good conditions for long-term development of our entire organization. Backed up by frequent acquisitions of well-established companies and an increasing proportion of recurring revenue, Vitec will continue along the path on which it has set out; operating in several independent and specialized niches in order to achieve enduring profitable growth. Lars Stenlund CEO2 VITEC INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2015 January-June 2015 The Vitec group’s conversion to business models with a greater percentage of recurring contractual income continues and reached a new all-time high during the first half of 2015. The shift in the mature business units have continued and the newly acquired businesses have contributed with a high percentage of recurring income from the outset. Operating profit has continued to improve as a result of a combination of cost-saving measures and a higher proportion of contractual income. Business Area Estate Agent has completed a conversion programme as a result of Swedbank Fastighetsbyrå AB’s announcement that they will be gradually shifting to a brokering system they have developed in-house. The business area, which still maintains a high production capacity after the conversion, will continue to invest in our web-based brokering system Express. During Q2, Express has continued to perform well in procurements and it is also gratifying that several clients return after having tried other solutions for a while. In Norway the development of our products continues. Fox publishing is now an integrated part of our business. Business Area Real Estate continues its strong trend of steady improvement in both sales and operating profit. The unit’s new products has been received well by both existing and new customers, sales are at a record level, and the delivery organization is nearly fully booked for the whole of 2015 and Q1 2016. Boplats Sverige, where our registered customers can offer lease agreements with right of tenancy continues to grow. An increasing number of property owners have subscribed to the service during the spring which now spans over more than 90 000 units. Business Area Media continues to increase its proportion of the recurring income with a higher operating margin. Following an upgrade of the technical platform in 2014, Media has a stable customer base. Our major customers have shown an increased demand for our services during Q2. Business Area Energy is showing higher profits and turnover. The unit continues to explore the European market. A number of webinars on our Aiolos Forecast Studio and NetSim products were held for potential customers in May and June. We have reached approximately 120 potential new users. Business Area Health, which delivers a complete web-based medical record system for the Finnish market, has during Q2 performed a number of demonstrations for potential customers. Many new customers show a great interest in our product, at the same time our existing customer base is stable and implements new modules. The major roll-out for the Finnish Student Health Service passed an important milestone in June. Business Area Auto, which offers a business system and an e-commerce platform for spare parts and accessories in the Norwegian market has seen normal development over the period. The unit enjoys stable operations that largely follows the seasonal patterns in the Norwegian spare parts sector. Business Area Finance and Insurance operates in the Danish and Swedish markets. Operations in Denmark were added after the first half of 2014, which is why the business area shows substantially increased growth in turnover. In Sweden a major roll-out is under way at Länsförsäkringar Fondliv and in Denmark we are in the final stages of a major technical upgrade to future-proof our products. Both projects are costly and will affect profitability in the short term.VITEC INTERIM REPORT JANUARY-JUNE 2015 3 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Sales and results April-June 2015 Revenues Net sales for the period amounted to SEK 152,7 million (116,7), which represents an increase of 31 %.

With the addition of apartments from southwest of Sweden 28 independent property owners are connected with applicants seeking for vacant apartments across the regions they are interested in. Administration of the rental is controlled by the respective property owner. An important success factor for the common marketplace are the broad support of both municipal and private operators. In a short time property owners with more than 90,000 apartments joined Boplats Sweden. According to Michael Georgsson, VP Business Development at Vitec, the interest remains very high and the goal is to become the largest, nationwide marketplace for vacant apartments with a first-hand contract. April 22: Cost-cutting program in Estate Agents Division As a consequence of Swedbank Fastighetsbyrå AB having announced its successive transition to a proprietary estate agent system, Vitec is adjusting its organization. A cost-cutting program has been initiated affecting the Estate Agents Sweden Division. Fully implemented, the program will reduce annual costs by approximately SEK 15 million, and is expected to have its full effect from the fourth quarter 2015. The ongoing rollout of the SaaS-based estate agents system Vitec Express continues as planned. May 6: Annual General Meeting of Vitec Vitec held its annual general meeting in Umeå and took the opportunity to celebrate that the company started almost on day 30 years ago. For the first time it was offered to shareholders who could not follow the AGM in place in Umeå to participate via webcast. Despite this, the meeting was attended by 130 participants who together represented approximately 66% of the voting rights. AGM participants resolved to adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the Parent Company and the Group, to distribute SEK 3.35 / share to shareholders and to grant the Board of Directors and the CEO from liability. Finally, noted Board and Chairman of the Meeting Crister Stjernfelt that all decisions were unanimous. After the AGM a buffet was served.

The share offering was oversubscribed several times, attracting strong interest from international and Swedish investors. With the funds raised we are well placed to deliver against our value adding growth strategy which is focused on achieving sales of over SEK 500 million and a positive operating result by 2020. STRONG SALES GROWTH CONTINUES We continued to deliver strong top-line growth with sales increasing by 48% to SEK 37.1 million in the second quarter. In Europe and ROW (Rest of World) we saw sales increase by 55% to SEK 13.7 million. This sales growth was driven by the increasing adoption of our antibiotic eluting products, CERAMENT G and CERAMENT V. The rapid uptake of these novel products is enabled by the growing body of clinical evidence supporting their ability to remodel to host bone and to deliver antibiotics to protect the healing process. We also have increased investment in our sales and marketing organization to give this message. In North America, our sales grew by 44% to SEK 23.5 million as CERAMENT BVF continued to gain share in the US market. Growth in the US was due to the success of our larger sales and marketing organization in leveraging our partner’s distribution network to increase uptake. In Q2 we succeeded for the first time in generating sales via all 54 distributors in the Zimmer Biomet network. GENERATING CLINICAL DATA TO DRIVE SALES BONESUPPORT is continuing to support the on-going investigator-initiated CERTiFy study, which is evaluating CERAMENT BVF in comparison to autograft (the current standard of care). Recruitment of the last patient into the study is planned by the end of 2017. This study is designed to generate both clinical and HEOR (health economics and outcomes research) data to increase the adoption of CERAMENT BVF. FIRST PATIENT RECRUITED IN FORTIFY STUDY In addition to driving sales of its currently approved products, BONESUPPORT’s strategy is to gain US regulatory approval for CERAMENT G. To achieve this goal the Company is conducting the FORTIFY study, which enrolled its first patient in May, with planned FDA filing by the end of 2020. PIPELINE PROGRESS The final element of the Company’s strategy is the development of novel CERAMENT based products that have been designed to promote bone growth. In July one of our pipeline projects received SEK 8 million of grant funding from Vinnova (Sweden’s innovation agency). This research will be conducted by an Indo- Swedish university research group. EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY We continue to invest in our commercial organization and growing the body of clinical evidence highlighting the benefits of our products. With our successful IPO, BONESUPPORT’s enhanced management team is executing the Company’s strategy to deliver a number of value generating milestones and meet our 2020 financial targets. CEO STATEMENT Richard Davies CEO of BONESUPPORT HOLDING AB (publ) SUCCESSFUL IPO TO FUND OUR GROWTH STRATEGYINTERIM REPORT BONESUPPORT JANUARY - JUNE 2017 3 COMPANY OVERVIEW COMPANY STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES Driving sales of currently approved products - Generating further supportive clinical data (incl CERTiFy) to drive the adoption of our CERAMENT products for broader range of indications -Increasing marketing and promotional spending particularly in the US -Increasing our sale footprint Successfully completing the FORTIFY IDE study The clinical data from this study is designed to support a PMA filing with FDA to gain approval for CERAMENT in the US with planned PMA filing in 2020. Progress pipeline of CERAMENT product candidates Novel product candidates are designed to promote growth capitalizing on CERAMENT’s unique drug eluting capabilities. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT BONESUPPORT research and development is focused on the CERAMENT platform, which has been used to generate both a well-developed clinical program and a pipeline of product candidates targeting enhanced bone growth that are in pre-clinical development. BONESUPPORTs IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) study, FORTIFY, recruited the first patient in May. FORTIFY study is designed to generate the clinical data needed to gain market approval for CERAMENT G in the US with planned launch in 2021. FORTIFY is a randomized multicenter controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CERAMENT G as part of open surgical repair of diaphyseal tibial fractures. The study is targeting to enroll up to 230 patients at up to 30 centers globally, with the aim of having at least 50% of the study data coming from US patients. The Company is conducting a number of clinical studies with its commercial products to drive increased adoption and usage both in existing and new markets. The largest studies are listed below.

CERTiFy plans to enroll 136 patients from more than a dozen top orthopedic trauma centers in Germany. Patient recruitment is planned to be completed by the end of 2017. CERTiFy is a non-inferiority study and positive results would support further use of CERAMENT BVF, taking share from the autograft segment, which is the most widely used treatment option globally for patients with bone voids. It is also anticipated that the results will be helpful in gaining improved reimbursement for CERAMENT BVF in Germany and certain other geographies. In addition to CERTiFy, BONESUPPORT is conducting or planning a number of other studies either investigator initiated or sponsored by the Company. These studies are designed to generate the data needed to support the use of currently approved products for additional indications. An investigator initiated study assessing the use of CERAMENT G in patients undergoing revision arthroplasty is due to start in Italy in the coming months. Feasibility assessments are also ongoing to start studies evaluating CERAMENT G for the management of diabetic foot (Italy) and chronic osteomyelitis (France). A paper covering an earlier investigator-initiated study was published in September 2016 (McNally et al, The Bone and Joint Journal (2016) Vol. 98-B, No. 9, 1289- 1296). The paper outlined compelling results of CERAMENT G in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. In conjunction with these on-going and planned clinical studies the Company continues to analyze the patient registry data that has been collected in recent years to generate further insights that supports the increased use of its CERAMENT portfolio of approved products. Research Activities – Pre-clinical Programs Targeting Enhanced Bone Growth BONESUPPORT is progressing its pipeline, see table below, of candidates that have been designed to add osteoinductive characteristics to the osteoconductive properties of the currently available CERAMENT products. At present the Company is evaluating several product candidates in pre-clinical development with the aim of choosing two to take into clinical development. The first candidate is targeted to enter the clinic in 2020. In July, one of the Company’s pipeline projects was awarded SEK 8 million in external funding from Vinnova (Sweden innovation agency). The grant funded project includes an assessment of the capability of CERAMENT G to deliver a combination of bone morphogenic protein-2 to induce bone formation and Zoledronic acid (ZA) to decrease secondary bone resorption. The Company has continued to generate positive animal model data using the combination of CERAMENT and a bisphosphonate (ZA). The results from Micro-CT scans look compelling and demonstrate that the local delivery of ZA has a positive osteoinductive effect on the bone- healing process. The Company has generated data in a large animal model, where monthly radiographs have been conducted to demonstrate the remodeling in the whole void. Publication is planned in 2018.

The increasing business volume and the positive growth in customer numbers are the main reason for the 19% increase in net interest. Fees and commissions amounted to net DKK 92 million in 2007 against net DKK 83 million in 2006, an increase of 11%. This positive development is attributable primarily to the bank’s initiatives within pension and asset management which, with the establishment of the bank’s Private Banking depart- ment over three years ago, are now having an effect on the less volatile income. Several areas of core expertise within Private Banking were implemented throughout the organisation during the latest two years as generalist knowledge among the bank’s consultants, and this has sup- ported the growth in the continuing pension deposits. Both payments into the bank’s pension schemes and customer’s transferring of their other pension arrangements to the bank are continuing at a healthy pace. Net fees and commissions were derived as follows: 1st half year 1st half year Full year 2007 2006 2006 Asset management 42 million 33 million 61 million Securities trading 23 million 23 million 42 million Guarantee commissions 14 million 12 million 26 million Payment handling 8 million 7 million 15 million Loan fees 2 million 3 million 6 million Other fees and commissions 3 million 5 million 8 million Total 92 million 83 million 158 million Value adjustments Value adjustments to securities and foreign currency etc. provided a capital gain of DKK 13 million against last year’s DKK 67 million. 1st half year 1st half year The capital gain spread: 2007 2006 Listed shares 5.8 million 2.2 million Listed share holding in Rella Holding - 14.1 million 48.9 million Interest-bearing claims and debts - 0.7 million - 3.5 million Foreign exchange income (core earnings) 8.9 million 5.5 million Sector shares (core earnings) 12.8 million 13.8 million Total 12.7 million 66.9 millionPage 4 of 16 Ringkjøbing Landbobank Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.dk/english The item “Foreign exchange income” is included in the core earnings as the profit derives exclusively from customer transactions, and the bank’s exposure is thus maintained at a low level. The item “Sector shares” is also included in the core earnings as the ongoing value adjustment (growth in value in the companies) from DLR Kredit, BankInvest Holding, Sparinvest Holding, Egnsinvest Holding, Letpension, PBS Holding, Multidata Holding, VærdipapirCentralen, PRAS and Bankdata can be compared with the wholly-owned subsidiaries of major banks. The bank’s historic shareholding in Rella Holding was listed on the stock exchange in the second quar- ter of 2006, whereby the book value increased from DKK 5 million to DKK 54 million. The value of the shareholding has fallen this year so that the book value is now DKK 31 million. The portfolio of shares etc. amounted to DKK 283 million at the end of the half-year, DKK 73 million of which was in listed shares with DKK 210 million in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio amounted to DKK 388 million. The bank’s total interest risk is 0.7% and remains at a low level. Costs Total costs including depreciation on tangible assets amounted to DKK 113 million against last year’s DKK 98 million, an increase of 16%. The rate of costs is unchanged relative to last year at 33%. The rate of costs was computed without in- cluding the positive value adjustment of sector shares and the result for the portfolio. Write-downs Write-downs on loans etc. were positive by DKK 18 million, while the item was positive by DKK 54 million in 2006. In general the bank’s loans portfolio is very strong, and given the good economic conditions and a tar- geted focus, it was thus possible to reverse net DKK 18 million in write-downs on individual commit- ments. The bank’s total account for write-downs and provisions amounted to DKK 285 million, equivalent to 1.6% of total loans, write-downs and guarantees. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounts to DKK 15 million, equivalent to 0.08% of the bank’s total loans, write-downs and guarantees.

In the second quarter, we also commenced a second stage, comprising a 43,500 square-foot warehouse for Boozt Fashion AB, one of the market’s better-known e-commerce companies, which will invest in first-class automated product handling. At E-City Engelholm, both small local and large international e-commerce companies are setting up in customised private or shared premises equipped for digital commerce. Here, the companies can, if they so wish, interact with one another in various areas, such as administration, service and distribution, thereby achieving synergies. We also offer a platform for growth through various operating solutions, resource sharing and flexible leases that provide greater adaptability to changing volumes in both the short and long term. E-City Engelholm is centrally placed, and the whole of northern Europe can be easily reached from here. The facility is also easy to reach for those who do not want to wait or pay for the final transport to the end consumer, but who would prefer to collect their goods themselves. This is made possible by short road connections and good parking facilities, but also by municipal transport connections directly at the site. e-commerce, which has grown steadily for quite some time, shows no signs of slowing down. Although total retail sales have shown strong growth in recent years, e-commerce is developing even more strongly. During 2015, it rose from 6.4 to 6.9 percent of total retail sales. Although it remains a fairly small percentage of trade, this is increasing. Durable goods in particular have driven this trend in recent years. However, sales of consumer goods via the Internet also continue to increase year after year. Although growth is occurring from low levels, new consumption patterns and the major players’ initiatives, often in proprietary e-commerce solutions, are expected to bring increased growth, even when measured as a percentage of total retail. E-City Engelholm E-City Engelholm E-City Engelholm takes shape Increased e-commerce imposes strict demands on flexibility of distribution, speed proximity and reliability. Consequently, in the highly competitive e-commerce sector, efficient logistics, short lead times and access to storage are a winning formula. With this as its starting point, Catena is continuing, through a majority- owned development company, to develop E-City Engelholm and the 157,000 square-metre site that permits logistics buildings totalling some 77,000 energy-efficient square metres.CEO’s review 3Catena AB Interim report January-June 2016 A well-integrated Catena generates growth Catena’s growth and development through the acquisition of Tribona can now be seen both in profits as well as in improved key performance indicators. The integration has progressed well and the two organisations have begun to work as one with an extreme focus on creating the best possible logistics solutions for the customers of both today and tomorrow. A year ago, we sold our “Haga Norra” development project in Solna. The transaction resulted in a cash injection of nearly SEK 1 billion. Our assessment was that the sale would provide opportunities to eventually expand the property portfolio value by almost SEK 3 billion. Now, a year later, we have, through the acquisition of Tribona, increased our property value by more than SEK 5 billion to a total of over SEK 10 billion. Thanks to a rapid integration process, we are now “back” with a focus on customers, new leases and day-to-day management. The high vacancy rate we noted at the end of the first quarter of just over 220,000 square metres has already been reduced to 180,000 square metres. Our largest individual lease has been achieved at Terminalen 3 in Malmö, where the tenant has also taken up occupancy. Other major new tenancies are Logex in Umeå, Coromatic in Stockholm and van Dieren in Katrineholm. Major new leases achieved during the quarter include the Tågarp 16:17 block in Arlöv, at the northern access to Malmö, where Espresso House has signed a lease for approximately 7,000 square metres and Mathem.se has signed one for more than 8,000 square metres. When these tenants are in place after the end of the year, the block, with its 53,000 square metres, will be the centre of a cluster of food distribution companies. Our growth is clear, rental income for the first six months increased by 66 percent and amounted to SEK 378 million compared with SEK 228 million in the same period last year, and the net operating surplus improved by 61 percent to SEK 278 million (173). Perhaps our most important performance measures, profit from property management, has increased by 26 percent from SEK 114 million to SEK 144 million and, in comparison with the first quarter, the improvement is a full 53 percent. As already mentioned, the occupancy rate has improved by 6 percentage points from 86 percent to 92 percent. Hopefully this is just the beginning, growth and improvement on all fronts is a good sign that we are on the right path and an indication of what is to come. Because of the continuing low interest rate environment, the value of our interest rate hedges continues to entail negative changes in value in our interest rate derivatives, which were down by SEK 140.5 million. For the sixth consecutive year, we arranged Logistics Day in Helsingborg, where we tried to capture the latest logistics trends. “Smarter, better and faster” summarises the requirements that are expected to be imposed on distribution and logistics in the future. Combined with steadily increasing flows of goods, this creates a great need for new and modern logistics properties in the right locations. We therefore continue to divest the older logistics properties, and in this quarter, the Partille 11:24 property was sold. Agreements have also been signed for the sale of the leaseholds for Terminalen 3 and Terminalen 4 to the City of Malmö for a property value of SEK 140 million. In connection with the agreement, we acquire the Sockret 1, 2 and 6 development properties and the land at Sockret 4 for a property value of SEK 50 million from the City of Malmö. To access additional developable land in Örebro, we have become a one-third owner in Torsjö Logistik AB with a holding of 720,000 square metres of first-class logistics land. Catena already has several logistics properties in the immediate vicinity at Torsjö. Detailed planning for the area now acquired is expected to be completed in the spring of 2019. We are currently upgrading existing logistics facilities at a high pace, selling older units and, in particular, building new and modern logistics properties. Our ongoing new construction of logistics premises currently amounts to 66,000 square metres. We have much to do before we are satisfied, but thanks to generally good demand, there is much benefit left to derive, after a much needed summer break!

Income from contracts with terms of more than three years accounted for approximately 59 percent of Catena’s contracted annual rent, which entails stable income with no appreciable variation between periods, except in connection with acquisitions and sales. The average remaining lease period is slightly more than four years. Duration of leases Duration Number contracts Contracted annual rent, SEK m Contracted annual rent, % 2016 44 9.3 1 2017 133 138.7 17 2018 42 61.4 8 2019 47 135.0 16 2020 36 92.2 11 2021 12 116.4 14 2022+ 52 272.9 33 Total 366 825.9 100 Property expenses Property expenses rose by 83 percent to SEK 100.1 million (54.6), mainly due to the property portfolio being considerably larger and a higher level of vacancies, resulting in a greater proportion of media costs being borne by the landlord. There are seasonal variations in the operation and maintenance of properties. Winters with much cold and snow entail higher costs for heating and snow removal. A hot summer can mean increased costs for cooling. These variations, that have the greatest impact during the winter and summer months, are, to some extent, offset by a change in billed expenses to tenants. Financial expenses Financial expenses amounted to SEK 121.7 million (49.5) and the increase is an effect of the acquisition of Tribona. As a consequence of the acquisition, average interest on borrowings, which have now increased overall, rose by approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in higher interest expenses. Financial expenses also include non-recurring items of approximately SEK 2 million, incurred as a consequence of the acquisition. Earnings Despite being burdened by substantial non-recurring amounts, profit from property management rose by 26 percent to SEK 143.7 million (113.6). The expenses of approximately SEK 20 million comprise a large number of individual items associated with the acquisition of Tribona, the largest of which is the reassessment of the year’s opening holding in Tribona, which, in connection with the preparation of the acquisition analysis for the now wholly owned holding, resulted in an expense of SEK 12 million being recognised under Participations in profit of associated companies. Profit for the period was SEK 103.3 million, which is SEK 270.6 million lower than in the year-earlier period, primarily due to negative changes in the value of derivatives due to long-term market rates having fallen, but also lower realised changes in value. A positive change in the value of investment properties was reported for the period, which was partially offset by a change in goodwill from the acquisition of Tribona. The unrealised changes in value are of an accounting nature and do not affect cash flow.

Compared with the first half of 2013, the bank noted increasing average loans and deposits in the half-year, but also noted a fall in the interest margin from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange earnings amount to net DKK 122 million in the first half of 2014 against net DKK 113 million in 2013, an increase of 8%. The increase is attributable primarily to greater activity and volumes within asset management and pensions and to greater trading activity, which has strengthened earnings. The total core income was 8% higher in the first half of the year, with an increase from DKK 424 mil- lion in 2013 to DKK 459 million in 2014. The DKK 35 million increase in total core income was af- fected positively by an extraordinary once-only income of the order of DKK 10 million in connection with the sale of the bank’s shares in Nets Holding A/S. Corrected for the once-only income, the bank considers the increase in core income satisfactory. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciations on tangible assets were DKK 142 million in the first half of 2014 against DKK 132 million last year, an increase of 7%. The rate of costs was computed at 30.8, still the lowest in the country. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods of difficult economic conditions as this provides a high level of robustness in the bank’s results. Impairment charges for loans Impairment charges for loans amounted to DKK 40 million in the first half of 2014. The level of im- pairment charges fell by 34% relative to the same period of last year and is equivalent in the first half of 2014 to 0.5% p.a. of total average loans, impairment charges, guarantees and provisions. The bank’s total account for impairment charges and provisions amounted to DKK 908 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 5.5% of total loans and guarantees. Actual losses and write-offs on loans etc. continue to be very low, and they were exceeded during the half-year by the items “Interest on the impaired part of loans” and “Receivables previously written off ”, such that the total account for impairment charges and provisions increased by net DKK 54 million during the first half of the year. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounts to DKK 98 million, equivalent to 0.6% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-hear. Given the low growth in the Danish economy for a number of years, which, however, is expected to improve this year, the bank is satisfied with the credit policy on the basis of which the bank is operat- ed. Based on the business cycle, the bank expects that impairment charges in all of 2014 will show a falling trend relative to 2013.

Result for portfolio and market risk The portfolio income for the first half of 2014 was DKK 44 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 213 million, DKK 28 million of which was in listed shares, while DKK 185 million was in sector shares etc. The bond port- folio amounted to DKK 4,351 million, and the majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds and short-term bank bonds issued by rated counterparties. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the profit of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 0.8% of the bank’s core capital after deduction at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposures to interest rate risk, listed shares etc. and foreign curren- cy remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a Value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) in the first half of 2014 was as follows: Risk in million DKK Risk relative to equity end of 1st half 2014 in % Highest risk of loss: 10.6 0.36% Lowest risk of loss: 4.7 0.16% Average risk of loss 7.6 0.26% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level. Profit after tax The profit after tax was DKK 245 million for the first half of 2014 against DKK 184 million last year. The profit after tax is equivalent to a return on equity at the beginning of the period of 18% p.a. after payment of dividend.

The bank’s deposits increased by 11% from DKK 12,654 million to DKK 14,054 million. The bank’s loans increased by 14% from DKK 12,570 million to DKK 14,283 million. The growth in the bank’s loans is broadly based on sectors with growth from both the branch network and the bank’s niche con- cepts, and primarily comes from new customers. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the half-year was DKK 1,438 million against DKK 2,615 million at the end of the first half of 2013. The fall in the portfolio of guarantees is due, among other things, to the fact that a number of guarantees were provided at the end of the first half of 2013 which resulted in actual loans later in 2013. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, with loans and deposits at the same level. The excess solvency relative to the statutory liquidity requirement is 169%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to DKK 0.7 billion, balanced by DKK 4.8 billion in short-term money market placings, primarily in Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. The bank’s loans portfolio is more than fully financed by the bank’s deposits and equity. In addition, part of the loans portfolio for wind turbines in Germany is refinanced back-to-back with KfW Banken- gruppe, and the DKK 1,136 million concerned can thus be disregarded in terms of liquidity. The bank requires no financing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must always be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. Capital reduction and share buy-back programme It was decided at the annual general meeting in February 2014 to cancel 60,000 own shares, and the capital reduction was finally implemented in April. The bank was further authorised at the general meeting to buy up to 110,000 own shares and set them aside for later cancellation. As of 5 August 2014, 45,000 own shares have been set aside for later can- cellation under the new share buy-back programme.

The development in this item should be compared to a 5% increase in lending. The net interest income was thus influenced by a falling interest margin, which reflects the competition in the sector. The net interest income was also influenced by the low interest rate, which had an impact in the second quarter in particular. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange income amounted to net DKK 144 million in the first half of 2015 against net DKK 122 million in 2014, an increase of 18%. The increase is attributable to the re- cord conversion activity within mortgage loans in the half-year, and earnings were also strengthened by the increasing volumes within asset management and greater trading activity. The total core income in the first half-year increased from DKK 459 million in 2014 to DKK 482 mil- lion in 2015. The increase should be viewed in the context of the fact that the total core income in the first half of 2014 was affected positively by an extraordinary once-only income of the order of DKK 10 million in connection with the sale of the bank’s shares in Nets. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciations on tangible assets were DKK 149 million in the first half of 2015 against DKK 142 million last year, an increase of 5% and in line with the budget for the first two quar- ters of the year. The rate of costs was computed at 30.8, which continues to be the lowest in Denmark and unchanged relative to the first half of 2014. The low rate of costs means great stability in the bank’s results. Impairment charges for loans Impairment charges for loans were DKK 29 million for the half-year against DKK 40 million in 2014, which is equivalent to 0.3% p.a. of the total average loans, impairment charges, guarantees and provi- sions, against 0.5% p.a. in the first half of 2014. The bank’s total account for impairment charges and provisions amounted to DKK 967 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 5.2% of total loans and guarantees. Actual losses and write-offs on loans etc. continue to be very low, and they were exceeded during the half-year by the items “Interest on the impaired part of loans” and “Receivables previously written off”, such that the total account for impairment charges and provisions increased by net DKK 35 million during the first half of the year. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounted to DKK 57 million, equivalent to 0.3% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-year. The total impairment charges for 2015 are expected to show a falling trend relative to 2014.Page 3 of 24 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4913 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Core earnings (Million DKK) 1st half 2015 1st half 2014 2014 2013 2012 2011 Total core income 482 459 907 844 823 767 Total costs and depreciations -149 -142 -298 -273 -265 -248 Core earnings before impairments 333 317 609 571 558 519 Impairment charges for loans etc. -29 -40 -87 -120 -157 -129 Core earnings 304 277 522 451 401 390 Core earnings were DKK 304 million against last year’s DKK 277 million. The realised earnings are above budget for the first two quarters of the year. Result for portfolio and market risk The result for portfolio for the first half of 2015 was DKK 15 million including funding costs for the portfolio. Seen in isolation, the portfolio income for the second quarter of 2015 was DKK -8 million due to the interest rate instability in the quarter. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 304 million, DKK 57 million of which was in listed shares etc. while DKK 247 million was in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio amounted to DKK 5,074 million, and the majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the profit of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 1.5% of the bank’s tier 1 capital (after deduction) at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposures to interest rate risk, listed shares and foreign currency remains at a moderate level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a Value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) in the first half of 2015 was as follows: Risk in DKK million Risk relative to equity end of 1st half 2015 in % Highest risk of loss: 25.8 0.82% Lowest risk of loss: 5.2 0.16% Average risk of loss: 16.8 0.53% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a moderate level. Profit after tax The profit after tax was DKK 249 million for the first half of 2015 against DKK 245 million last year. The profit after tax is equivalent to a return on equity at the beginning of the period of 17% p.a. after payment of dividend. Balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet at the end of the half-year stood at DKK 22,118 million against last year’s DKK 19,675 million.Page 4 of 24 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4913 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Deposits increased by 18% from DKK 14,054 million at the end of June 2014 to DKK 16,628 million at the end of June 2015. The bank’s deposits on 30 June 2015 were influenced temporarily by major deposits from the bank’s core customers. The bank’s loans increased by 5% from DKK 14,283 million at the end of June 2014 to DKK 15,032 million at the end of June 2015. The loans figure for 2015 includes reverse transactions to a total of DKK 288 million, and the increase in the bank’s loans excluding these transactions was 3% relative to the end of June 2014. The growth in the bank’s loans is broadly based on sectors with underlying growth in new customers from both the branch network and the bank’s niche concepts. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the half-year was DKK 2,667 million against DKK 1,438 million at the end of June 2014 and DKK 2,218 million at the end of 2014. The portfolio of guarantees is thus still extraordinarily high as a result of a high level of activity within conversions. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, and the excess liquidity relative to the statutory requirement for liquidity is 204%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounted to DKK 0.8 billion, balanced by DKK 6.2 billion in short-term money market placings, primarily in Da- nish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. The bank’s deposits were DKK 1.9 million greater than loans excluding reverse transactions at the end of June, and the bank’s loans portfolio is thus more than fully financed by deposits and the bank’s eq- uity. In addition, part of the loans portfolio for wind turbines in Germany is refinanced back-to-back with KfW Bankengruppe, and DKK 1,031 million concerned can thus be disregarded in terms of li- quidity. The bank requires no financing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must al- ways be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. New liquidity regulations will come into force with effect from 1 October 2015, viz. the so-called LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) key figure. The key figure will show the ability of banks to honour their payment obligations for a 30-day period without access to market funds, and the key figure will subse- quently replace the current Section 152 liquidity key figure. The key figure is computed as the ratio of the bank’s cash and cash equivalents / liquid assets to its payment obligations for the next 30 days as computed in accordance with specific rules. Non-SIFI banks must have a cover of minimum 60% on 1 October 2015, gradually increasing by 10% on 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2017 and by 20% on 1 January 2018 such that the key figure must be minimum 100% on 1 January 2018. SIFI banks must have a cover of 100% as early as 1 October 2015. Ringkjøbing Landbobank wishes to follow the rules applying to SIFI banks and it is thus the bank’s target that the LCR key figure should be 100% on 1 October 2015. On 30 June 2015 the bank’s LCR key figure was 229% and the bank thus already met the target at the end of June.

ID No. 556669-4153 July 18, 2017 2 CEO STATEMENT Continued strong development and good results in all business areas The second quarter of 2017 showed continued strong growth with improved profitability in the contracting operations. I feel particularly proud that all four business areas now have a strong wind in their sails and that our business model, with turnkey solutions from start to finish, is appreciated in the market. I often meet with customers, who confirm that our culture is reflected in the commitment and pride shown by Serneke’s employees. Moving ahead, I consider two of our most important tasks to be continuing to utilize the strength of the entire group and maintaining the strength of our corporate culture. As you read this quarterly report, I would like to underscore the fact that the sale of half of the Karlastaden project, which occurred in the corresponding quarter last year, had a considerable impact on the Group’s earnings. It is important to have this factor in mind when comparing the quarters. It is clear that the Group as a whole is continuing to grow, and I would like to highlight the contracting element in particular. Construction increased its income for the second quarter by 60 percent over the period to SEK 1,292 million (809) and Civil Engineering increased its income for the second quarter by 63 percent to SEK 152 million (93). For both business areas, the explanation is increased production capacity combined with strong demand. The operations currently have more and larger projects in progress than they did in the corresponding quarter last year. The order book continues to grow in pace with the increased rate of production and the order book for the entire Group now amounts to SEK 8,308 million (6,480). The increase of 28 percent is explained by continued good order bookings. The consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 6.5 percent, with Construction increasing to 3.4 percent (1.6) in the second quarter and Civil Engineering improving its results strongly for the second quarter, from a negative 12.9 percent to a negative 1.3 percent. The average number of employees increased by 160 on the corresponding quarter last year to 919 employees today. We have strong cash and bank balances and are well equipped for continued growth and to meeting any challenges from changing external conditions. Our cash and bank balances also enable us to seize the appropriate opportunities when offered by the market. Organic growth focusing on good control and improved profitability The contracting operations within Construction and Civil Engineering continued to grow, with improved profitability and strong order bookings. With a clear objective of focusing on larger and more complex projects, we have established processes and systems that allow us to specialize our activities towards our selected market. The model of establishing ourselves organically in identified growth areas when a suitable entry-level project appears, grants us the opportunity to grow in a controlled and cost-effective manner. Over the past quarter, Construction has established itself in Växjö, Eskilstuna and Västerås. Additional locations have been identified, but we will go there when the right project comes along, not on speculation. While Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö remain our individual largest markets, in the past quarter, Trollhättan has stood out. We have long been a well-established actor here and have now signed a contract for the construction of a new school for SEK 485 million with the municipally-owned Trollhättan Tomt AB as our appreciated partner. This is a brilliant example, not only of the breadth of our offer, but also of the strength exerted by being specialized in major projects for large-scale, professional clients. It is equally enjoyable to now see Civil Engineering embark on its first project in Stockholm where the market is very good and where collaboration, with Construction and Project Development in particular, is offering considerable development potential and access to attractive projects. The development of proprietary projects and properties adds value and generates opportunities With established operations in Project Development and Property Management, we are not only opening up favorable business opportunities for our respective business areas, but also creating conditions for turnkey transactions that are unlikely to be possible for players who are merely property developers or contractors. With control of the entire value chain and aINTERIM REPORT JANUARY – JUNE 2017 Serneke Group AB (publ), Corp. ID No. 556669-4153 July 18, 2017 3 genuine team spirit, we can create turnkey solutions that are also appreciated by partners such as the Municipality of Järfälla. Through an agreement with the Municipality of Järfälla, we have created an opportunity for ourselves over the next few years, alongside the Municipality, to develop the next-generation of urban development, where housing, sports, retail and public services meet in mixed urban environment that is sustainable in the long term. For me personally, this is a project that is particularly dear to my heart. We combine the knowledge of the entire organization to become engaged and to affect our community positively. Each business area should, in itself, be profit generating in its core operations, although synergies also generate added value for other parts of the Group. Mälardalen University, which Project Development has sold to Hemsö and which generated profit for Project Development in the second quarter, is a good example, where Construction will also have a contract in the order of SEK 643 million over the next few years. The same applies to our joint venture Karlastaden project, for which the City of Gothenburg adopted the new detailed development plan on June 15. With the trend now moving in the direction of signing agreements with operators, as in the case of Choice Hotels for the unique hotel to be built in the area, or to preparing the construction contracts for the area, all business areas are involved to the highest degree and are contributing to the whole. Serneke Property Management recently acquired the property neighboring Karlstaden to better utilize the opportunities that a partnership within the Group opens up. This was also a significant factor in the second quarter’s other major transaction when Property Management entered into an agreement to acquire Säve Depå, which, together with our existing holdings, gives us control of more than three million square meters of land at the old Säve airport site. We are already seeing great interest from a large number of operations and I am convinced that this area has the potential to become an amazing business involving the entire Group. Long-term strategy creates clear conditions internally and externally The first half of 2017 was characterized by continued strong demand in the market and an internal focus on delivering profitable growth. We continue to be selective, choosing projects that build long-term sustainable customer relationships and a stable order book. The concept of Group collaboration will be central to our continued success and we are already seeing clear examples of how commitment and a lack of prestige, without internal impediments, enables Serneke to deliver cost- effective transactions in close partnership with customers. The strategy of four collaborative business areas pushing jointly towards challenging and clear objectives forms a crucial part of our success, although the company’s culture is even more important to me. Serneke will continue to be a company lacking in internal prestige and that encourages innovation and develops committed and motivated employees. Our strong order bookings, frequently from repeat customers, demonstrates that our approach is appreciated and I am proud of all of the employees currently representing our brand. Together we are building the Serneke that our customers appreciate and with which more people seek employment. We still have a lot to do, but for me as founder and CEO, it is particularly important that we continue to protect our unique culture and that all employees also feel proud of what we are creating and contributing together.

Yours sincerely, Ringkjøbing Landbobank John FiskerPage 2 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4916 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Management report Core income The net interest income in the first half of 2013 was DKK 304 million against DKK 316 million in 2012, a decrease of 4%. Since the first half of last year the bank has experienced a decrease in volumes and a weakly falling interest margin, and the very low interest level has resulted in a lower return on the bank’s securities portfolio and its liquid resources. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange earnings amount to net DKK 113 million in the first half of 2013 against net DKK 98 million in 2012, an increase of 15%. There are primarily greater activity and volumes within asset management and pensions, which strengthen earnings relative to 2012, and the income from guarantee commissions has been increasing. Total core income was 1% higher in the first half of the year, increasing by DKK 6 million from DKK 418 million in 2012 to DKK 424 million in 2013. The bank considers the increase from the 2012 level satisfactory. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciation on tangible assets were DKK 132 million in the first half of 2013 against DKK 133 million last year, a decrease of 1%. The half-year’s costs include DKK 7 million for the insurance scheme under The Guarantee Fund for Depositors and Investors, under which the bank’s current share is 0.68%. The rate of costs was computed at 31.2%, which is 2% better than the same period last year. The rate of costs is still the lowest in the country. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods of diffi- cult economic conditions as this provides a high level of robustness in the bank’s results. Impairment charges for loans Impairment charges for loans etc. amounted to DKK 61 million in the first half of 2013 against DKK 79 million in 2012. The level of impairments is falling relative to the same period last year and is equivalent to 0.8% p.a. of total average loans and guarantees. The bank’s customers still appear to be coping better with the weak economic conditions than the average in Denmark. The bank’s total account for impairment charges for loans and provisions for guarantees amounted to DKK 828 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 5.2% of total loans and guarantees. Actual write-offs for loans continue to be very low, and they were exceeded during the period by the income items “Interest concerning the impaired part of loans” and “Receivables previously written-off”, such that the account for impairment charges for loans and provisions for guarantees increased by net DKK 70 million during the half-year. The portfolio of loans with suspended calculation of interest amounts to DKK 97 million, equivalent to 0.6% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-year. Given the low growth in the Danish economy in 2012, which is expected to continue this year, the bank is satisfied with the conservative credit policy on the basis of which it has always operated. As a natural part of the economic cycle, the bank’s losses are expected to remain at a relatively high level in 2013, but with a downward trend relative to the previous year.Page 3 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4916 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Core earnings (Million DKK) 1st half 2013 1st half 2012 2012 2011 2010 2009 Total core income 424 418 823 767 758 753 Total costs and depreciations -132 -133 -265 -248 -240 -238 Core earnings before impairments 292 285 558 519 518 515 Impairment charges for loans etc. -61 -79 -157 -129 -138 -159 Core earnings 231 206 401 390 380 356 Core earnings before impairments for the half-year were DKK 292 million, the best half-year ever in the bank’s history for this figure. Core earnings were DKK 231 million against DKK 206 million last year, an increase of 12%, and core earnings are now approaching the top of the range of DKK 350-425 million announced previously for the entire year. Result for portfolio The result for portfolio for the first half of 2013 was positive by DKK 15 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 253 million, DKK 36 million of which was in listed shares, while DKK 217 million was in sector shares etc. The bond port- folio amounted to DKK 3,671 million, and the majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds and short-term bank bonds with rated counterparties. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the result of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 1.3% of the bank’s core capital after deduction at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposures to interest rate risk, listed shares etc. and foreign curren- cy remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a Value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) in the first half of 2013 was as follows: Risk in million DKK Risk relative to equity end of 1st half 2013 in % Highest risk of loss: 26.1 0.95% Lowest risk of loss: 2.5 0.09% Average risk of loss 14.7 0.53% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level. Profit after tax The profit after tax was DKK 184 million for the first half of 2013 against DKK 178 million last year. The profit after tax is equivalent to a return on equity of 14% p.a. after payment of dividend.Page 4 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 7624 4916 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet total at the end of the half-year stood at DKK 17,800 million against last year’s DKK 18,033 million. The bank’s deposits fell by 2% from DKK 12,939 million in 2012 to DKK 12,654 million at the end of the first half of 2013. The bank’s loans fell from DKK 12,869 million to DKK 12,570 million, a fall of 2%. In the first half of 2013, the bank enjoyed a very satisfactory underlying growth in new customers from both its branch network and within the niches Private Banking and wind turbine financing. The growth in loans in re- cent years has been more than absorbed by a bigger return flow on the bank’s loans portfolio, inter alia because of the changed patterns of behaviour in society, with a greater proportion of savings and with customers who want to trim their balance sheets. There was, however, a weak increase of DKK 146 million in the loans portfolio for the first half of 2013 relative to the end of 2012. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees etc. at the end of the half-year was DKK 2,615 million against DKK 1,687 million at the end of June 2012. The portfolio of guarantees etc. increased by DKK 948 million relative to the end of 2012. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, with loans and deposits at the same level. The excess solvency relative to the statutory requirement was 145%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to only DKK 929 million, balanced by DKK 4.4 billion in short-term money mar- ket placings, primarily in Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. The bank’s loans portfolio is more than fully financed by deposits and the bank’s equity. In addition, part of the German loans portfolio for wind turbines was refinanced back-to-back with KfW Banken- gruppe, and DKK 797 million can thus be disregarded in terms of liquidity. The bank requires no fi- nancing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must always be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. The Guarantee Fund for Depositors and Investors The fixed costs of the insurance scheme under The Guarantee Fund are recognised under “Other oper- ating costs”. As was the case in the first quarter of 2013, an additional amount was imposed on the bank in the se- cond quarter of 2013 by the Winding-up and Restructuring Department of the Guarantee Fund, inter alia from the estate in bankruptcy of Fjordbank Mors. The total costs for the first half of 2013 total DKK 1.6 million, which is recognised under “Expenses for bank packages”. Share buy-back programme It was decided at the annual general meeting in February 2013 to cancel 100,000 own shares, and the capital reduction was finally implemented at the end of April 2013. The bank was further authorised at the general meeting to buy up to 130,000 own shares and set them aside for later cancellation. As of 6 August 2013, 35,000 own shares had been set aside for later can-
1 AAK’s Interim Report for the second quarter, 2012 Chief Executive´s comments Continued strong growth and profit improvements driven by Food Ingredients coupled with very strong operational cash flow Operating profit reached SEK 218 million (196), before acquisition related costs of SEK 7 million, an improvement of 11 percent compared to the corresponding quarter in 2011. Business Area operating profit:  Food Ingredients reached a record high second quarter of SEK 156 million (120), an improvement of 30 percent.  Chocolate & Confectionery Fats reported operating profit of SEK 65 million (70).  Technical Products & Feed had another challenging quarter but reached SEK 20 million (28). Earnings per share increased by 3 percent, from SEK 3.04 to SEK 3.14. Sales amounted to SEK 4,207 million (3,907). Very strong cash flow in the second quarter of SEK 351 million (-41). This amount includes changes in working capital which improved by SEK 196 million (-272). Volume and business development The second quarter was characterized by a Group volume growth compared to last year of 11 percent. Food Ingredients volume was up 21 percent; for comparable units the growth was 2 percent, comprising increased value added products. Volume in Chocolate & Confectionery Fats remained stable, up 1 percent, and in Technical Products & Feed volume was down 6 percent. AAK Acceleration We continue to see positive effects of the AAK Acceleration program (Growth-Efficiency- People). Recent Acquisitions During the later part of the second quarter AAK made two acquisitions; Oasis Foods Company in the US (annual sales SEK 925 million) and Crown-Foods A/S in Denmark (annual sales SEK 60 million). Both companies are active within Food Ingredients - Food Service. Concluding remarks The impact on our industry from the more difficult general economy in Europe is difficult to predict. However, based on AAK’s customer value propositions for health and reduced costs, our customer product co-development and solutions approach, and the AAK Acceleration program, we continue to remain prudently optimistic for the future, mainly driven by a very strong Food Ingredients business.

Net sales Net sales increased by SEK 300 million mainly related to acquired units, organic growth and a positive currency translation impact of SEK 107 million. Operating result Operating profit before acquisition related costs for the second quarter was record high reaching SEK 218 million (196), an improvement of 11 percent. The impact of currency translation was positive SEK 6 million. AAK Louisville has contributed to the Group result according to plan. The contributions of the more recent acquisitions were immaterial. After acquisition costs of SEK 7 million the operating profit reached SEK 211 million (196), an improvement of 8 percent. Operating profit per kilo excluding acquisition costs remained stable at SEK 0.60 (0.60) per kilo. Food Ingredients continued to show strong improvements while Chocolate & Confectionary Fats and Technical Products & Feed reported decline. Operating profit per kilo including acquisition costs amounted to SEK 0.58 (0.60). Net financial cost Net financial cost was stable at SEK 31 million (30). Borrowing margins were higher, offset by lower average borrowings. Cash flow and Investments Cash flow from operating activities excluding changes in working capital amounted to SEK 155 million (231), lower than last year mainly due to higher taxes paid. Further, positive cash flow arose from a reduction in working capital by SEK 196 million in the second quarter (last year working capital increased by 272). Cash flow from operating activities including changes in working capital was positive SEK 351 million (negative 41). After net investments (mainly maintenance investments and acquisitions) totalling SEK 517 million (95), cash flow was negative SEK 166 million (negative 136). Recent acquisition of Oasis Foods Company AAK strengthened its position in the North American Food Service market by acquiring Oasis Foods Company (Oasis). Oasis provides an expansive variety of quality products such as edible oils, margarine, spreads, shortenings, vinegars, mayonnaise and sauces. Founded in 1975 Oasis employs approximately 160 people at Hillside, New Jersey, USA and had revenues of approximately SEK 925 million in 2011. Oasis is a well-run company and it represents an excellent platform for our North American ambitions. The company´s wide variety of established Food Service products and brands significantly broadens AAK’s product offerings in one of the largest food service market in the world. The New Jersey location close to our Port Newark plant provides easy access to some of the largest population centres in the country. The acquisition is expected to have limited impact on AAK´s operating profit for 2012. Recent acquisition of Crown-Foods A/S AAK strengthened its position in the Scandinavian Food Service market by acquiring Crown- Foods A/S in Denmark (Crown). The acquisition will strengthen AAK’s ability to supply a broad portfolio of Food Service products to the Scandinavian customers. Crown is a local market leader producing sauces and dressings. Founded in 1988 and located in Mørkøv, Denmark, Crown employs approximately 20 people and had a turnover of approximately SEK 60 million in 2011. The acquisition is expected to have limited impact on AAK´s operating profit for 2012. Financial position The equity/assets ratio amounted to 37 percent (36 percent at 31 December 2011). Net debt at 30 June 2012 amounted to SEK 3,211 million (SEK 3,141 million on 31 December 2011). At 30 June 2012, the Group had total credit facilities of approximately SEK 6,000 million. Employees The average number of employees at 30 June 2012 was 2,269 (2,065 on 31 December 2011).The net change consists of a reduction in Scandinavia and the UK, in line with the restructuring programs, offset by increases in focused growth markets and recent acquisitions.3 Group – Q2 2012 *Excluding acquisition related costs 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Q2 08 Q3 08 Q4 08 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 R o llin g 1 2 m o n th s , S E K m illio n Q u a rt e r, S E K m ill io n AAK Group - Operating profit* Quarter Rolling 12 months 0,00 0,10 0,20 0,30 0,40 0,50 0,60 0,70 0,80 0,90 0,00 0,10 0,20 0,30 0,40 0,50 0,60 0,70 0,80 0,90 Q2 08 Q3 08 Q4 08 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 R o llin g 1 2 m o n th s , S E K /K g Q u a rt e r, S E K /K g AAK Group - Operating profit per kilo* Quarter Rolling 12 months 6,0% 7,0% 8,0% 9,0% 10,0% 11,0% 12,0% 13,0% 14,0% 15,0% Q2 08 Q3 08 Q4 08 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 Return on Net Operating Assets - Rolling 12 months 0 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 1 600 1 800 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Q2 08 Q3 08 Q4 08 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 R o llin g 1 2 m o n th s , '0 0 0 M T Q u a rt e r, ' 0 0 0 M T AAK Group - Volume Quarter Rolling 12 months 0,00 0,50 1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00 3,50 4,00 4,50 5,00 Q2 08 Q3 08 Q4 08 Q1 09 Q2 09 Q3 09 Q4 09 Q1 10 Q2 10 Q3 10 Q4 10 Q1 11 Q2 11 Q3 11 Q4 11 Q1 12 Q2 12 Net Debt/Ebitda4 The AAK Group, first six months 2012 Volume Volume increased by 9 percent during the first six months mainly due to acquisitions and organic growth.

Yours sincerely, Ringkjøbing Landbobank John FiskerPage 2 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Management report Core income The net interest income in the first half of 2012 was DKK 316 million, an increase of 9% relative to last year. Since last year we have seen an increasing trend in net interest income deriving from the in- creasing deposits and a rising interest margin. Like the rest of the financial sector, the bank has in- creased its interest margin. However, the very low interest rate is resulting in a lower return on the bank’s securities portfolio and liquid resources. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange earnings amount to net DKK 98 million in the first half of 2012 against net DKK 79 million in 2011, an increase of 24%. The large sums within asset manage- ment and the pension area have affected earnings positively, and there has been a brisk level of activity within conversion of credit association loans. Total core income was 11% higher in the first half of the year, increasing from DKK 375 million in 2011 to DKK 418 million in 2012. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciations on tangible assets were DKK 133 million in the first half of 2012 against DKK 123 million last year, an increase of 8%. Most of the increase is the new fixed premium paid to the Guarantee Fund for Depositors and Inves- tors, which will be booked as a cost from 2012. It was decided in connection with Bank Package IV to establish an insurance scheme with a premium fixed relative to the deposits for which cover is provid- ed. DKK 1,950 million will be paid annually to the Fund, in which the bank currently has a 0.65% share, equivalent to DKK 12.7 million a year. Payments will be made to the Fund until it has reached DKK 7,500 million. Future costs for the Fund will be financed by the payments, so it is not possible to determine how low long this cost will continue. On the other hand, the fluctuating costs of bank bailouts will disappear in time. DKK 6.1 million was debited to the scheme in the first half-year. Notwithstanding the new insurance scheme, the rate of costs improved by 3% relative to 2011 and is now 31.9%, still the lowest in Denmark. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods of diffi- cult economic conditions as the bank’s results are thus very robust, which is also reflected in the com- putation of the bank’s individual solvency requirement. Write-downs on loans Write-downs on loans amounted to DKK 79 million in the first half of 2012 against DKK 54 million in the preceding year. The level of write-downs remains acceptable and is equivalent to 1.1% p.a. of the total average of loans, write-downs, guarantees and provisions. The bank’s customers still appear to be coping better with the weak economic conditions than the average in Denmark. The bank’s total account for write-downs and provisions amounted to DKK 731 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 4.8% of total loans and guarantees. Actual write-downs on loans remain at a very low level, exceeded in the half-year by the income items “paid into previously written-down loans” and “interest income on customer commitments for which provisions were made”, and the ac- count for write-downs and provisions thus increased by DKK 81 million during the first half-year.Page 3 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com The portfolio of loans with zeroed interest amounts to DKK 91 million, equivalent to 0.6% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-year. Given the low growth experienced by the Danish economy in 2011, which is continuing this year, the bank is satisfied with the conservative credit policy on the basis of which the bank has always been run. The bank’s losses are still expected to remain at a relatively high level in 2012, equivalent to that of the past three years, as a natural part of the economic cycle. It is also still the bank’s judgment that the credit policy, the diversified loans portfolio and the bank’s location in Central and West Jutland will have a positive effect on the bank compared to the general level of losses in the banking sector as a whole.

Result for the portfolio The result for the portfolio for the first half of 2012 was positive by DKK 33 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 265 million, DKK 27 million of which was in listed shares etc. while DKK 238 million was in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio amounted to DKK 3,632 million, and the great majority of the portfolio consists of AAA- rated Danish mortgage credit bonds and short bank bonds with rated Nordic counterparties. The total interest rate risk - computed as the impact on the result of a one percentage point change in the interest level - was 1.2% of the bank’s core capital after deduction at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposure to interest rate risk, exposure in listed shares etc. and for- eign exchange exposure remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) was as follows in the first half of 2012: Risk in million DKK Risk relative to equity end of 1st half in % Highest risk of loss: 27.5 1.07% Lowest risk of loss: 3.6 0.14% Average risk of loss 14.1 0.55% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level.Page 4 af 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • DK-6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Result after tax The result after tax was DKK 178 million for the first half of 2012 against DKK 135 million last year. The result after tax is equivalent to a return on equity of 15% p.a. after payment of dividend. Balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet total at the end of the half-year stood at DKK 18,033 million against last year’s DKK 18,440 million. Deposits increased by 4% from DKK 12,404 million to DKK 12,939 mil- lion relative to 2011. The bank’s loans decreased by 2% to DKK 12,869 million. The underlying growth in new customers from the branch network and within the niches Private Banking and wind turbine financing remains good. The changed pattern of consumption with a higher rate of saving and the general trend by many customers to trim their balance sheets means, however, that in general there is a greater return flow on the bank’s existing loans portfolio than previously, so that the entire growth in the first half of the year generally went into neutralising this flow. The bank’s loans grew by 1% in 2012. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the half-year was DKK 1,687 million against DKK 1,044 million in 2011. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, with loans and deposits at the same level. The excess cover relative to the statutory requirement is 145%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to only DKK 693 million, balanced by DKK 4.4 billion in short-term money market placings, primarily Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short- term money market. The bank’s loans portfolio is thus more than fully financed by deposits and the bank’s equity. In addi- tion, part of the German loans portfolio for wind turbines was refinanced back-to-back with KFW Bankengruppe, and the DKK 761 million in question can thus be disregarded in terms of liquidity. The bank requires no financing for the coming year to meet the minimum requirement that it must always be able to manage for up to 12 months without access to the financial markets. The deposit guarantee scheme The future fixed costs of the insurance scheme are recognised under other operating costs. We have, however, received an additional charge from the estate in bankruptcy of Fjordbank Mors, which was recognised as an expense of DKK 2 million in the half-year. Buy-back programme It was decided at the general meeting to cancel 100,000 repurchased own shares. Following expiration of the deadline in the statutory notice, the reduction to 4,940,000 shares was implemented in the se- cond quarter of 2012. The bank’s holding of own shares at the end of the first half of 2012 was 32,967.

Q22 Catena AB Interim report January-June 2015 During the second quarter, Catena signed an agreement to acquire, through a corporate transaction, the Förmannen 4 property in Ängelholm at a property value of SEK 120 million. Located on the property, which is strategically located in a trade and logistics area closely adjacent to the E6/E20 motorway, there is a 22,000 square metre logistics warehouse. The property, which is shown in the picture, is in very good condition and has two tenants, with the larger lease being valid until 2023. Rental income amounts to about SEK 12 million per year. During the period, Catena signed a contract in the same area for the acquisition of the 15,000 square metre logistics property Rebbelberga 26:37. Rental income amounts to about SEK 9 million per year.

Additionally, in the second quarter, Catena acquired 60 percent of a company that owns the development property part of the Norra Varalöv 31:2 property in Angelholm. The property comprises 112,000 square metres of land where the detailed development plan allows for logistics buildings of about 56,000 square metres. This affords Catena substantial opportunities to build new logistics premises close to the E6. All of the properties are well suited to Catena’s portfolio and strengthen our position in the Öresund region. Catena strengthens its position in the Öresund RegionCEO’s review 3Catena AB Interim report January-June 2015 Strengthened balance sheet and a good basis for continued growth The major event during the period was undoubtedly the divestment of our development project at “Haga Norra” in Solna. During the previous financial year, which was also Catena’s first as a logistics property company, the focus was on generating strong cash flow. Now, in the second year, the goal is to build a strong balance sheet to enable future expansion. Although the divestment of “Haga Norra” contributes profit of more than SEK 100 million, above all, it provides a stronger balance sheet and will generate a liquidity injection of close to SEK 1 billion over time. For Catena, it feels highly satisfying to be able to sell off a low-yield development project to establish a good foundation for expansion in logistics. We are in no hurry and will carefully select transactions suited to our strategic portfolio. During the period, profit from property management, that is, cash flow from current operations, rose to SEK 114 million (102). This is perhaps our most important performance measure and on a rolling 12-month basis, profit from property management amounts to SEK 216 million, corresponding to SEK 8.44 per share. The letting ratio remains at 96 percent, that is, the same as at year-end. The high letting ratio, combined with good work in property management, means that the surplus ratio remains at 76 percent. Due to favourable profitability in on-going property management, combined with successful development efforts and resulting increases in property values, as well as the divest- ment of Haga Norra, we are able to report very strong half-year profit of fully SEK 374 million. During the period, Catena acquired two properties for SEK 140 million and also signed an agree- ment to acquire three additional properties for nearly SEK 200 million. We will continue to acquire properties as opportunities arise, although we look primarily to new production to generate growth. Our two major on-going new production projects in Malmö and Katrineholm will generate revenue from the end of the year and from the first quarter of 2016. In my CEO statement a year ago, I wrote the following: “We are well on the way to establishing Catena as the leading property company in the logistics sector.” Our development, refinement and growth have continued since then and, for the fifth consecu- tive year, we also organised “Logistics Day” in Helsingborg, in which we captured the latest trends. “Faster, cheaper and better” summarises today’s trends and the demands that will be placed on future logistics solutions. Combined with steadily increasing goods flows, this is generating a need for new and modern logistics properties in the right locations. Through collab- oration with customers, Catena will sustainably develop these future logistics solutions.

Income from contracts with terms of more than three years accounted for approximately 54 percent of Catena’s contracted annual rent, which entails stable income with no appreciable variation between periods, except when affected by acquisitions and sales.

In comparable portfolios, property expenses have decreased by SEK 1.4 million, mainly due to a mild winter and energy efficiency measures that have been implemented. Financial expenses Financial expenses amounted to SEK 49.5 million (47.5) during the period. The period was characterised by completed refinancing processes, the restructuring of the credit portfolio and lower market interest rates. Earnings Profit from property management over the year improved by 11 percent to SEK 113.6 million (102.1), mainly due to the effect of acquired properties, income-enhancing invest- ments and a certain decrease in operating expenses. Profit for the period rose by SEK 327.1 million to SEK 373.9 million (46.8) due to changes in property values, and this was mainly attributable to the Haga Norra project properties in Solna, outside Stockholm. Profit is also affected by increased values of derivatives, mainly due to long-term market interest rates having increased during the year. The unrealised changes in value are of an accounting nature and do not affect the existing cash flow.

All four business areas have increased their income and, despite a selective downturn in the market compared with a year ago, we are seeing continued high demand. In the first half of 2018, income increased by SEK 564 million, corresponding to 22 percent, in line with our target for 2020. Order bookings for the quarter and the order backlog at the end of the period were both lower than in the preceding year, partly as a result of the order mix containing a larger share of collaborative projects than previously, but also as a consequence of a more cautious market, which has influenced the pace at which decisions are taken in connection with new projects. We are monitoring developments carefully and are raising our readiness for possible changes in the market, although we currently assess the underlying needs of the market, our specific market and the customers we address, as providing a stable foundation for continued expansion in line with our established objectives. In the second quarter, the Group’s operating profit amounted to SEK 74 million (95), a decrease of 22 percent. A transaction within Project Development in the second quarter of 2017 impacted earnings positively by SEK 52 million. During the quarter, our efforts to develop and establish improved structural and process capacity, aimed at supporting our continued rapid expansion, accelerated, impacting earnings negatively. The contracting operations continue to perform strongly, growing by a total of 13 percent during the period. Their operating profit increased by 5 percent to SEK 44 million. Our largest business area, Construction, grew 11 percent during the second quarter, which is lower than previously but still at a higher rate than the market. Our construction operations continue to prioritize appropriate orders over higher growth. Our strategy remains to focus on major orders, collaborative projects and to be selective in choosing customer segments. We continue to compete with market leaders for major projects and the new agreements secured during the period are mainly in industry and offices, but also in properties for public sector clients. Operating profit for Business Area Construction decreased slightly compared with the corresponding quarter last year, amounting to SEK 42 million (44). The operating margin was 2.9 percent, which is in line with the previous quarter. Business Area Civil Engineering continues its trend of bringing home more major projects and increased its sales during the second quarter to SEK 190 million (152), an increase of 25 percent. Civil Engineering shows profitable growth for the fourth consecutive quarter, which is pleasing following a phase of building up the operations. The strategy continues to be to compete for major infrastructure projects, for which we perceive considerable future demand. Business Area Project Development increased its revenues by 68 percent during the period and although profitability did not appear during the quarter, we take a positive view of the underlying and long-term profitability trend, particularly as we now approach the end of the first intensive phase of investment and expansion. In Business Area Property Development, which is dominated by the Säve holding, two significant events occurred during the quarter. In part, a new, more solid plan was drawn up for the entire Säve area and, in part, former official restrictions on the Säve area were lifted. The latter prompted a decision to revalue the area, aided by an external party, as the conditions for the area’s development have changed significantly. This revaluation had a positive effect on earnings for the quarter. Enhancing competitiveness on the way towards our objectives During the quarter, a bond issue totaling MSEK 700 was implemented, with previous bonds being redeemed. The surplus from the new bond provides increased strategic scope for implementing the growth strategy, and the company’s improved bond terms provide a lower average cost of capital. We are continuing on our course towards ambitious targets. To date, our strategy has been successful, and now, with a slightly different market situation, it is important to listen carefully to the market, to stay close to our customers and to continuously improve our offering with the same energy as before. Last but not least, and absolutely crucial, is retaining and recruiting the best personnel. For this reason, in May, the Board of Directors took a further step to support the company’s ambitions by approving a new share saving program that I hope will help Serneke continue towards its objective of being the sector’s most attractive employer by enabling employees to share in the growth in value. Ola Serneke, President and CEOINTERIM REPORT SERNEKE | 3 GROUP DEVELOPMENT ORDER BOOKINGS AND ORDER BACKLOG Order bookings during the second quarter amounted to SEK 1,328 million (1,742). Order bookings reflect a favorable product mix as well as a good geographic spread and consist predominantly of industrial and office properties. Order bookings fluctuate between quarters depending on when contracts are signed, and this is particularly evident when it comes to the procurement of major projects, which the Group has chosen to prioritize. The metropolitan areas of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö and their environs continue to be the Group’s most important markets, even though the Group is expanding geographically and securing significant assignments in new markets. The Group’s order backlog at the end of the second quarter amounted to SEK 7,398 million (8,308).

All business areas increased their sales during the quarter. Construction increased by 11 percent while Civil Engineering increased by 25 percent, providing a total increase for the contracting operations of 13 percent. Project Development increased its sales by 68 percent, with more projects having transitioned to the production phase. Property Management showed an increase in sales of 200 percent, generated from the expanded property portfolio and hotel income. Operating profit amounted to SEK 74 million (95), a decrease of 22 percent. Income from the contracting operations amounted to SEK 44 million (42), an increase of 5 percent. The operating loss from Project Development was SEK 6 million (profit 47). The decrease is due to the preceding year’s sale of the Mälardalen University projects, which generated a gain of SEK 52 million, corresponding transactions have not occurred during the quarter. Operating profit for Property Management amounted to SEK 42 million (3), which was attributable to increased property values by SEK 43 million (decrease 1). Net financial items were negative in the amount of SEK 16 million (2). During the quarter, early redemption of bonds affected net financial items by a negative SEK 12 million (0). The Group reported an estimated tax expense of SEK 10 million (6). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 48 million (87) and earnings per share before dilution for the quarter were SEK 2.06 (3.74). JANUARY-JUNE 2018 Consolidated income amounted to SEK 3,166 million (2,602), an increase of 22 percent. Operating profit amounted to SEK 126 million (142). The contracting operations generated an operating profit of SEK 80 million (79), an increase of 1 percent. During the period, changes in the value of investment properties affected operating profit positively by SEK 43 million (18). The share in the profit of associates and joint ventures amounted to a negative SEK 8 million (positive 49). The share in profit was burdened by intra- Group eliminations attributable to the Karlastaden project as a result of increased activity in the project. Last year, the sale of the Mälardalen University project also generated SEK 38 MSEK towards the share in profit. Net financial items were negative in the amount of SEK 19 million (9) and the Group’s estimated tax amounted to SEK 20 million (13). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 87 million (120) and earnings per share before dilution were SEK 3.74 (5.20).

The tight budgetary situation and the weak economies in Southern Europe are restraining consumption which is also resulting in lower activity among advertisers. We see that the Internet advertising and e-commerce markets are decreasing in Southern Europe. The economies in Northern Europe continue to perform better than those in Southern Europe. Increasing competition is now starting to have an impact on our numbers. Price pressure is increasing and some players have enticed customers by offering very attractive prices. Some players have been prepared to do business involving a loss for the sole purpose of gaining volumes, while others have focused on delivering at lower margins and with higher efficiency. So far we have opted to defend our profitability in individual deals. During the past year, we have invested in systems and processes in order to boost efficiency further. This work continued during the second quarter including investments in a more efficient delivery organisation and a higher rate of automation. The outlook for the travel sector that is so important for us continues to weaken. The World Travel & Tourism Council expects to adjust downwards its forecast for travel in Europe in 2012 from the decline of 0.3 per cent it announced previously. The weak consumption pressed our second largest sector Shopping & Retail, which saw a decrease in revenues. An important task ahead is to win business and thereby ensure a strong market position, particularly in the large markets UK, France and Germany. We currently have a good position in the UK and France while we could benefit from a stronger position in the German market. We are investing resources in sales and marketing in order to provide the market units with better support in their efforts to gain business. The ongoing work is yielding results. Industry accolades such as winning the prize of ‘Publishers' Choice of Network’ at the Performance Marketing Awards 2012 is an endorsement that the work on simplifying and strengthening relationships with our publishers is making a difference. Another important focus area for us is to ensure a leading position in mobile channels and generate revenue from this area. On average, 5.7 per cent of the traffic in our network in the various countries currently comes from mobile devices, which is more than twice as much as one year ago. Consumer behaviour in a mobile device is different than in a computer, which means that marketing activities also need to be designed differently than in traditional e-commerce. We are also adapting our technology and partnering with several customers in order to generate better business in this area. This is my final report as President and CEO. Next week, I will pass the baton to Rob Wilson who was recruited to our British operations last year and who has extensive experience from performance-based marketing. Tradedoubler will continue to meet challenges and seize the opportunities that arise. My conviction is that the company with all its capable employees has a good basis to be a winner. Urban Gillström President and CEO4(21)| Tradedoubler Interim report January – June 2012 MARKET DEVELOPMENT The tough climate that characterised Tradedoubler's markets during the first quarter of 2012 also persisted during the second quarter. The weak economic performance in Southern Europe including France meant that the company's market in these countries showed no growth or negative growth. The Group is considered to have performed better or in line with the markets as a whole. The more favourable economic situation in Northern Europe is contributing to higher volumes, both as regards Internet advertising and e-commerce. However, these markets are more mature than those in Southern Europe and are also expected to face continued consolidation. In the present situation, certain players are prioritising volumes over profitability, which is leading to mobility among customers. So far, Tradedoubler has opted to defend its profitability. The outlook weakened for the travel sector ― Tradedoubler's most important sector. This sector has displayed strong growth for many years with a significant and increasing portion of bookings via Internet. The trade organisation World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) which predicted in March that the European travel and tourism sector would decline by 0.3 per cent during 2012, flagged in June that it will lower this forecast. Tradedoubler's revenues from the sector fell during the second quarter to account for approximately one quarter of sales. The Internet is an important channel for many travel companies and the price pressure in the sector is considerable. The activity in Tradedoubler's second largest sector Shopping & Retail decreased. The sector accounts for approximately 15 per cent of sales. Price pressure is also evident here, but to a lesser extent than in the travel sector. Business volume in the sector Media & Entertainment, which accounted for 6 per cent of Tradedoubler's sales, increased very strongly in the network. Also Tradedoubler’s revenues increased sharply from the sector, although to a lower extent. TRENDS For many advertisers the Internet is now one of the largest channels, if not the largest of all. This is the case in the travel industry, but also for more and more players in other sectors. As the experience of performance-based marketing grows and the Internet becomes more important as a channel, companies are increasingly adopting a strategic perspective to this and are building up greater competence of their own in the field. This means that demand for system solutions is increasing, which at Tradedoubler is reflected by increased activity in the Technology business segment. The unit accounted for 12.1 per cent of gross profit during the second quarter, compared to 9.2 per cent one year ago. The mobile channel is growing and developing at a rapid rate, although still from very low levels. A research study among 2,000 smartphone users in France, the UK, Sweden and Germany commissioned by Tradedoubler during the spring showed that the increased availability of information is changing consumer behaviour. More than half of the users have purchased other things than downloadable material via their phone and a total of 70 per cent use their mobile to seek information before a purchase. They check the selection available and prices, take advantage of local offers and download voucher codes. More and more types and even larger purchases are being made via mobile. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT A considerable part of the product development work is focused on creating the basis for Tradedoubler to capture a strong position in mobile channels, while a series of investments are being made to maintain the Group's leading position in Network, particularly within Affiliate. During the second quarter, new products were released in order to handle discount coupons or voucher codes that were rolled out in the entire network. Voucher codes are a powerful way to get consumers to execute purchases when they visit certain websites, for instance, for price comparisons. Offers can e.g. be designed for consumers that are found within a certain geographical area. For Tradedoubler, it is important that the tracking works so that the right affiliate gets paid for driving traffic. Since many people make price comparisons via mobile, voucher codes are an especially important sales tool in such devices. Advertisers have rapidly learned to appreciate the opportunities and voucher codes currently account for over five per cent of sales in Network. App download tracking was released during the second quarter, which makes it possible to monitor the number of consumers who download a certain app, their activity in that app and how they move between various apps. The launch of AdCodes continued during the second quarter and the service is currently used in all large markets. AdCodes allows publishers to set aside a special area on their website for automated dynamic adverts from Tradedoubler. Tradedoubler then continually fills this space with optimised content. Concurrently, quality enhancement work is also being carried out involving improved product feeds. These feeds contain more detailed information about products and services from different advertisers, which make it easier for consumers who visit sites that gather information such as price comparison and travel sites. THE GROUP'S RESULTS Consolidated net sales during the period amounted to SEK 1,213.9 M (1,257.3), a fall of 4 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. During the second quarter, consolidated net sales amounted to SEK 573.7 M (604.8), a fall of 6 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Volumes in Tradedoubler's two largest sectors, Travel and Shopping & Retail fell during the quarter while volumes grew strongly within Media & Entertainment. Gross profit during the period amounted to SEK 287.2 M (306.8), a fall of 7 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Gross profit during the quarter amounted to SEK 140.8 M (149.5), which was also a decline of 6 per cent adjusted for changes in exchange rates. Network's gross profit decreased during the quarter to SEK 123.8 M (135.8), which explained more than all of the total decline in consolidated gross profit.

Net interest income increased by 1% from DKK 296 million to DKK 300 million. The underlying trend in income from business with customers is good, but the item was negatively affected by the low interest level, as interest income from financing of the bank’s own holding of bonds was two percentage points lower in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009, equivalent to a lower income for the half-year of approx. DKK 17 million. Fees, commissions and foreign exchange earnings amount to net DKK 82 million in 2010 against net DKK 65 million in 2009, an increase of 26%. This development is primarily attributable to the fact that the volume of trading within securities has picked up, and to increasing earnings from the bank’s asset management activities as a result of increasing volumes. Costs and depreciations Total costs including depreciation on tangible assets amounted to DKK 120 million against last year’s DKK 113 million, an increase of 6%. The rate of increase is expected to be lower for the year. The rate of costs was marginally higher than last year’s level and was computed at 30.8, which continues to be the lowest in Denmark. A low rate of costs is especially important in periods of difficult economic conditions as the bank’s results are thus very robust, which is also reflected in the computation of the bank’s individual solvency requirement. Write-downs on loans Write-downs on loans resulted in a fall to net DKK 63 million for the half-year against last year’s DKK 69 million. The net write-downs for the half-year are equivalent to 0.85% p.a. of total average of loans, write-downs, guarantees and provisions. The bank’s customers appear to be coping better with the weak economic conditions than the average in Denmark, and the present level of write-downs is considered satisfactory. The bank’s total account for write-downs and provisions amounted to DKK 512 million at the end of the half-year, equivalent to 3.4% of total loans and guarantees. Actual write-downs on loans this half- year continue to be appreciably below the write-downs recognised as an expense in the accounts, so that the account for write-downs and provisions increased by net DKK 45 million in the half-year. The portfolio of loans with zeroed interest amounts to DKK 56 million, equivalent to 0.37% of the bank’s total loans and guarantees at the end of the half-year. In general the bank’s loans portfolio is strong. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority assessed in their report from June 2010 that the bank’s credit risk is relatively low compared to that of other institutions. Given the recession in 2009 in the Danish economy and the fall in value of many assets concurrently with increasing unemployment, the bank is satisfied with the conservative credit policy on the basis of which the bank has always operated. The bank’s losses are expected to remain at aPage 3 of 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • 6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com relatively high level this year, a natural part of the economic cycle. However, in the bank’s judgment the credit policy, the diversified loans portfolio and the bank’s location in Central and West Jutland will have a positive effect on the bank compared with the general level in the banking sector as a whole.

Result for the portfolio The result for the portfolio for the first half-year was positive by DKK 28 million including funding costs for the portfolio. The result is attributable to a gain on interest-bearing debts and debt. All securities are included at market value. The bank’s holding of shares etc. at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 256 million, DKK 24 million of which was in listed shares etc. while DKK 232 million was in sector shares etc. The bond portfolio at the end of the half-year amounted to DKK 1,803 million, and the great majority of the portfolio consists of AAA-rated Danish mortgage credit bonds. The total interest rate risk, computed as the impact on the result of a one percentage point change in the interest level, was 0.3% of the bank’s core capital after deduction at the end of the half-year. The bank’s total market risk within exposure to interest rate risk, exposure in listed shares etc. and foreign exchange exposure remains at a low level. The bank’s risk of losses calculated on the basis of a value-at-risk model (computed with a 10-day horizon and 99% probability) was as follows in the first half of 2010: % risk relative to equity Risk in DKK end of the half-year Highest risk of loss: 16.9 million 0.77% Smallest risk of loss: 2.5 million 0.11% Average risk of loss 9.1 million 0.41% The bank’s policy remains to keep the market risk at a low level.Page 4 of 21 Ringkjøbing Landbobank A/S Torvet 1 • 6950 Ringkøbing • Tel. +45 9732 1166 • Fax +45 9732 1800 • CVR-no. 37536814 • post@landbobanken.dk www.landbobanken.com Result after tax The result after tax was DKK 144 million in the first half of 2010 against DKK 116 million in the same period last year, an increase of 24%. Tax of DKK 46 million was calculated, giving an effective tax rate of 24.3%. The result after tax is equivalent to a 14% return on equity at the beginning of the period. The balance sheet The bank’s balance sheet total at the end of the half-year stood at DKK 18,544 million against last year’s DKK 18,215 million. Deposits increased by 12% from DKK 9,982 million to DKK 11,194 million. The bank’s loans remain unchanged at DKK 13,070 million. The bank’s portfolio of guarantees at the end of the first half of 2010 was DKK 1,357 million against DKK 1,386 million in 2009. Liquidity The bank’s liquidity is good, and the excess liquidity relative to the statutory requirement is 228.3%. The bank’s short-term funding with term to maturity of less than 12 months amounts to only DKK 1.2 billion, balanced by DKK 4.3 billion in short-term money market placing, primarily in Danmarks Nationalbank, Danish banks and liquid securities. The bank also had undrawn confirmed credit facilities with foreign banks with term to maturity of over 12 months to the equivalent of a total of DKK 0.2 billion as backup facilities. The bank is thus not dependent on the short-term money market. Rating Ringkjøbing Landbobank was rated for the first time in May 2007 by the international credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service. The bank’s ratings since the start are: Financial strength C+ Short-term liquidity P-1 Long-term liquidity A1 These ratings were most recently confirmed in April 2010 with negative outlook. The bank is highly satisfied that the rating has been maintained despite the gloomy prospects for the Danish economy. Ringkjøbing Landbobank is thus the only Danish bank which was not downgraded in 2009. Bank Package I Together with most of the financial sector in Denmark, Ringkjøbing Landbobank joined Bank Package I, which runs until 30 September 2010 and provides an unconditional guarantee by the Danish state for Danish banks’ deposits and senior debts. The guarantee premium was DKK 29 million in the first half of 2010. The guarantee premium for the remaining period until 30 September 2010 will amount to DKK 15 million. In the first half of 2010, losses of DKK 13 million were booked for Bank Package I etc. on the net realisation principle and on the basis of the information published by the Financial Stability Company on expected losses.

Events occurred after June 30, 2017 • Acarix AB has resolved to implement two incentive programmes (Series 2017/2020 and Series 2017/2021) through issuance of warrants to senior executives, employees, members of the Board of Directors and other key persons. Such programmes were adopted at a general meeting on May 24, 2017. The warrants are recognized during third quarter 2017 when they were granted. 1ACARIX AB (PUBL) JANUARY – JUNE 20172 Message from the CEO The decision to purchase CADScor®System was explained by Morten Bøttcher, MD PhD FESC, head of the Cardiac Imaging center at the Hospital Unit West in Denmark and associate professor at Aarhus University: “We have conclu- ded that, with its ability to rule out Coronary Artery Disease with a 97% negative predictive value, this advanced, easy to use device could indeed have the potential to be deployed as a routine frontline test.” In the important German market, Prof. Dr. Christian Hamm, Medical Director at Kerckhoff Klinik, Bad Nauheim, Director at Med. Klinik I, University Hospital, Giessen and past President of the German Society of Cardiology com- mented on the release of CADScor®System: “We have a multitude of diagnostic methods to examine patients with suspected stable angina in the hospital setting, but accurate, easy to use, and non-invasive diagnostic aids for an optimal pre-hospital triage are missing. CADScor®System has the potential to improve the diagnostic pathway for the benefit of both patients and cost-effectiveness.” We are thrilled by the fact that CADScor®System for non-invasive, non-radiation acoustic detection of Coro- nary Artery Disease is now a commercially available device for routine clinical use. During the quarter, we presented Acarix and the CAD­ Scor®System at several key meetings and events. In April, the system was promoted at DGK 2017 in Mannheim, the annual meeting of the German Society of Cardiology. The system was demonstrated at a booth and latest study results were discussed at a satellite symposium highlighting a trial involving 1,675 patients from two Danish hospitals showing that CADScor®System rules out Coronary Artery Disease with 97% negative predictive value. Also in April, we parti- cipated in the Swedish Society of Cardiology spring meeting in Malmö, and in May the CADScor®System was showcased at the British Cardiovascular Society Meeting in Manches- ter. Participation in such significant congresses is an integral part of our commercial strategy providing an ideal platform to exchange with key decision makers face­to­face as well as create and increase interest and awareness of Acarix and CADScor®System. We were very pleased with the results of the congresses and the general interest in our technology which generated an important number of new potential customer contacts within a highly targeted audience. We have a sharp focus on commercialization and we are investing in building additional capabilities and platforms to ensure CADScor®System unfolds its potential. In this regard, we have established – and we are expanding – a dedicated sales organization and a subsidiary in Germany, Acarix GmbH. I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your conti- nued support, confidence, and trust. SINCERELY, SØREN RYSHOLT CHRISTIANSEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Dear shareholder, During the second quarter of 2017 we announced the first commercial sales of the Acarix CADScor®System, in line with the communicated strategy. This was a historic milestone for Acarix.ACARIX AB (PUBL) JANUARY – JUNE 20173 Financial Report Revenues Acarix launched the CADScor®System on the German, Da- nish and the Swedish market during second quarter and announced the first 3 orders which generated revenues amounting to kSEK 193. Expenses Total expenses (R&D and SG&A) for the second quarter amounted to kSEK 7,110 compared to kSEK 2,458 same period last year. The cost increase compared to second quarter previous year is mainly related to accelerating commercial activities and the fact that capitalization of development costs ended in second quarter in connection with commercialization and initial sales of the CADScor®- System. Furthermore, personnel costs have increased during the quarter due to employment of staff in the newly established German subsidiary. Total expenses for the first six months amounted to kSEK 11,043 (4,753). Result During second quarter the group reported an operating loss of kSEK –6,994 compared to kSEK –2,458 same pe- riod previous year. While capitalization of development costs related to CADScore System expired during the pe- riod, depreciation of capitalized development costs was commenced. Depreciation during second quarter amounts to kSEK 320 of which kSEK 71 was capitalized into deve- lopment costs.. Tax income amounted to kSEK 500 for the quarter com- pared to kSEK 894 same period last year, both related to Danish R&D tax credit. A net loss for the second quarter amounted to kSEK –6,508 compared to kSEK –1,964 same period last year. Earnings per share was SEK –0.28 for the second quarter compared to SEK –0.17 same quarter last year. In the first six months the group reported an operating loss of kSEK –10,927 against a loss of kSEK –4,753 same period last year. Tax income amounted to kSEK 956 for the first six months compared to kSEK 1,794 same period last year, both related to Danish R&D tax credit. A net loss for the six first months amounted to kSEK –10,000 compared to kSEK –3,509 same period last year. Earnings per share was SEK –0.43 for the six first months compared to SEK –0.31 same period last year. Intangible assets Capitalization of development costs related to CAD­ Scor®System has been initiated since August 2015 when TÛV issued a certificate of compliance (CE­mark) for the product. Capitalization ceased when the product was laun- ched in the market during second quarter and amortization of development costs was initiated. Development costs in progress as of June 2017 amounted to kSEK 21,177. Capitalization of development costs and acquired rights, including currency translation adjustment, amounted to kSEK 26,847.
