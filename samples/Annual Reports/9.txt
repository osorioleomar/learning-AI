Making strides in smokeless
Much has changed since Swedish Match was listed as a publicly 
traded company in 1996. Back then, our smokeless tobacco busi-
ness consisted of chewing tobacco and moist snuff in the US, and 
snus in Scandinavia. Snus and moist snuff combined were about as 
big as chewing tobacco in terms of sales, and together, snus and 
moist snuff accounted for about one-eighth of company sales. 
Today, Swedish Match is truly a different company with a truly dif-
ferent vision. Dramatically higher sales for snus and moist snuff, an 
emerging snus business in the US, and opportunities for the intro-
duction and development of traditional and modern forms of 
smokeless tobacco worldwide are only a few of the phenomenal 
changes over the years.
