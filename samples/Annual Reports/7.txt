Chairman's statement

Making great progress in 
the green transformation

For the third year running, 2016 was 
the warmest year ever, and the global 
 concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has 
never been higher. Halting climate change 
requires a fundamental transformation of the 
world's energy systems from fossil fuels to 
renewable energy sources. 

DONG Energy is the energy company in 
Europe which has come the furthest in the 
transition to renewable energy, and 2016 was 
yet another important milestone. The Group's 
earnings from Wind Power doubled to DKK 
11.9 billion and for the first time  exceeded 
earnings from oil and gas  production. 
We installed 0.6GW of new offshore wind 
 capacity and completed the conversions of 
two CHP plants in Aarhus and Copenhagen 
to  sustainable biomass. The Group's CO2 
emissions have been halved relative to 2006, 
and our goal is for DONG Energy to phase out 
coal completely by 2023. 

The transformation of our business to 
 increasingly more renewable energy also 
means becoming more international. Today, 
we are constructing and operating offshore 
wind farms in Denmark, the UK, Germany and 
the Netherlands, while also maturing new 
projects in the USA and Taiwan. 

In June 2016, we completed an IPO, the 
biggest in Danish history, and in December 
2016, DONG Energy was included in the OMX 
C20 index on Nasdaq Copenhagen. I would 
like to thank both Danish and international 
investors for the trust which they have shown 
our company. 

In November 2016, we decided to initiate a 
process aimed at divesting the Group's oil 
and gas production activities. The decision 
should be seen in light of our desire to become 
world-leading in green energy. We have created 
a strong and competitive oil and gas business 
in the North Sea. The time has now come to find 
new owners who can provide the best possible 
conditions for developing this business area.

Our efforts to improve safety continued 
in 2016, and the injury frequency was at a 
record low. Making DONG Energy an even 
safer workplace is a key priority for the Board 
of  Directors. We will therefore continue our 
efforts to improve safety standards to ensure 
that everybody working for DONG Energy – our 
employees and our business partners  – get 
safely through their working day. 

Profit after tax for the year was DKK 12.2 
billion for the continuing operations – the best 
result ever in the history of DONG Energy and 
a significant increase compared to 2015. On 
behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to 
thank our management and employees for the 
significant results achieved in the past year.
