Annual report 2017

The Ørsted Way
Let’s create a world
that runs entirely on
green energy

Contents

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges for life on
Earth. Today, the world mainly runs on fossil fuels. We need
to transform the way we power the world; from black to
green energy.

At Ørsted, our vision is a world that runs entirely on green
energy. We want to revolutionise the way we power people
by developing green, independent and economically viable
energy systems. By doing so, we create value for the societies
that we are a part of and for all our stakeholders.

The way we work is based on five guiding principles:

Integrity
We are open and trustworthy
and uphold high ethical standards

Results
We set the bar high, take ownership
and get the right things done

Passion
We are passionate about what
we do and proud of what we achieve

Safety
We never compromise on health and safety
standards

Team
We value diversity and collaborate in a
non-hierarchical, respectful and trusting way

Integrity is our root. Passion is our energy.
Team is our strength. Results give us freedom.
The safe way or no way.

Chairman’s statement

The transformation of the energy supply to 
green energy is one of the biggest challenges 
facing the world. Today, more than 80% of the 
world’s energy supply comes from the burning 
of fossil fuels, which leads to serious climate 
change and impacts people’s living conditions 
all over the planet. If we are to slow down this 
development, we need to supply the world 
with energy in a sustainable manner. 

Over a period of 11 years, Ørsted has been 
transformed from a Danish utility company 
based on coal, oil and gas to an international 
energy company based on green energy. In 
2017, we decided to phase out our use of coal 
by 2023, and we divested our oil and gas 
business. We also guaranteed our Danish resi-
dential customers that the power they receive 
from us is generated by offshore wind farms.

With the decisions we made in 2017, we com-
pleted our strategic transformation from black 
to green energy. None of the other major en-
ergy companies in Europe have come this far 
in their transformation processes, and among 
this group, we are now the fastest-growing 
company. As a result, we are a completely 
different company today. That is why we de-
cided to change our name to Ørsted, inspired 
by the world-renowned Danish scientist H.C. 
Ørsted.

Our vision is a world that runs entirely on green 
energy. We have strong competences within 
sustainable energy solutions in all parts of our 

“With the decisions we made in 2017, we 

completed our strategic transformation 
from black to green energy. None of the 
other major energy companies in Europe 
have come this far in their transfor-
mation processes.

business.  We want to build on these strengths 
and help the world’s transformation to green 
energy systems. 

Our commitment to sustainability is funda-
mental. We therefore run our business in a way 
that supports the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). In our Sustainabil-
ity Report, you can read more about how we 
contribute to these goals.

The heading for our strategy is ’Green growth’. 
In the coming years, growth will primarily be 
driven by our build-out of offshore wind, where 
we have the largest investment programme in 
the sector. We are also looking into new growth 
opportunities within green energy generation, 

intelligent customer solutions and solutions 
integrating generation and consumption. 

per share, enabling us to retain an attractive 
level of dividend. 

In 2017, we continued our tireless work to im-
prove safety for our employees and suppliers. 
We achieved a lost-time injury frequency of 
1.6, the lowest level ever in the Group’s history. 
On this basis, we are now switching to an 
even more fine-meshed measuring method 
comprising all accidents, whether they lead to 
absence or not.

Profit for the year from continuing operations 
amounted to DKK 13.3 billion, our best ever 
result. The Board of Directors recommends 
to the annual general meeting that dividend 
payments be increased from DKK 6 to DKK 9 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would 
like to thank the management and employees 
for having created one of the most successful 
energy companies in Europe, and one that is 
leading the way towards a world which runs 
entirely on green energy.
