2017 in brief

Financial results

  Total volumes were up 8 percent (7) and organic volume 
growth was 5 percent (2).

  Net sales amounted to SEK 26,436 million (22,057). The 
increase was mainly due to positive product mix and 
increased raw material prices, partly offset by a negative 
currency translation impact of SEK 327 million.

  Operating profit reached SEK 1,786 million (1,615), an 
improvement of 11 percent. The currency translation 
impact was negative SEK 19 million. Operating profit at 
fixed foreign exchange rates improved by 12 percent.

  The largest business area, Food Ingredients, reported an 
operating profit of SEK 1,107 million (996), an improve-
ment of 11 percent. Operating profit per kilo increased by 
3 percent, to SEK 0.77 (0.75).

  Business area Chocolate & Confectionery Fats reported 
an operating profit of SEK 735 million (664), an improve-
ment of 11 percent. Operating profit per kilo increased by 
1 percent, to SEK 1.82 (1.81).

Key events

  In January, we launched our new company program The 
AAK Way which will guide us through 2019. The AAK 
Way will focus on the following five priority areas: Go to 
Market, Operational Excellence, Special Focus Areas, 
Innovation, and People.

  For the Annual General Meeting in May, the Nomination 
Committee of AAK AB proposed new election of Mikael 
Ekdahl as Chairman of the Board and Gun Nilsson and 
Bengt Baron as Board members. The Annual General 
Meeting resolved in accordance with the proposal.

  Following the strategy to broaden our nutritional focus we 
delivered our first volumes of Akovita® in June. Akovita® 
is our new product range for the senior nutrition market 
and contains ingredients such as plant sterol esters which 
are clinically proven to maintain and even reduce the 
cholesterol level in the blood which is supported by Article 
14(1) health claim in the EU.

  In July, our CEO and President Arne Frank suddenly and 
very unfortunately passed away. Arne joined AAK in 2010 
and developed AAK into a world-leading player in the 
market for value-adding vegetable oils and fats.

  The smallest business area, Technical Products & Feed, 
reported an operating profit of SEK 84 million (100), 
a decrease by 16 percent. Operating profit per kilo 
decreased by 17 percent, to SEK 0.30 (0.36).

  Operating cash flow including changes in working capital 
amounted to SEK 1,099 million (1,213). Cash flow from 
working capital was negative, amounting to SEK 388 
million (negative 263). Good working capital management 
has impacted cash flow favorably. However, this was 
offset by a continued organic volume growth, a net nega-
tive impact from higher raw material prices, and working 
capital tied up for our new factories in Brazil and China.

  Earnings per share increased by 19 percent, to SEK 
28.24 (23.71).

  Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), calculated on a 
rolling 12 months basis, was 15.6 percent (15.8). ROCE 
declined due to increased raw material prices which 
impacted the first six months in 2017, investments in 
Brazil and China, and the acquisition of California Oils 
Corporation in 2016.

  Our new speciality and semi-speciality edible oils factory 
in Zhangjiagang, China was officially inaugurated in 
September. With the new plant in operation, we have 
taken a major step forward in our global growth strategy 
and it brings us closer to our customers in yet another key 
market. The fully automated, multi-oil and multi-process 
plant has an initial production capacity of 100,000 MT 
per year, and opens up many new possibilities for our 
customers in China in a wide range of applications.

  In November, AAK’s Board of Directors appointed Johan 
Westman as new President and CEO of AAK AB. Prior 
to joining AAK, Johan was Senior Vice President Europe 
and Managing Director of the BlankLight division at Shiloh 
Industries, a global innovative solutions provider to the 
mobility market with headquarters in Valley City, Ohio, 
USA. Johan will start no later than June 1, 2018.

  At the end of December, we signed our first commercial 
contract for TROPICAO™, our chocolate solution for hot 
climate markets.
