Fabless business 
model

Close customer 
relationships

Global presence

We work with the world’s leading 
semiconductor fabrication and module 
assembly companies. This allows us to 
focus our resources on research and 
development in order to deliver the 
breakthrough technologies that our 
customers need to stay ahead of their 
competitors.

We are a close and reliable partner to our 
customers, fully supporting them from 
prototype to final production. Providing 
the highest levels of local technical 
and customer support is critical for us 
to capitalize on opportunities in new 
markets, and essential for our customers 
to achieve fast time-to-market.

With physical presence in all the world’s 
main markets, we stay close to our 
customers to make sure our innovation 
cycles are in-synch. Our broad array of 
over 3’500 customers in the consumer, 
industrial and automotive markets 
also allows us to stay close to market 
requirements and emerging trends.

Comprehensive 
product lines and IP

Our success depends on our ability 
to deliver continuous innovation. 
We therefore direct our research and 
development efforts to the development 
of ever smaller, higher-performance 
products. 

Over the years we have also amassed an 
extensive intellectual property portfolio 
of numerous issued and pending patents 
covering key technologies used in our 
target markets.

Focus on quality

Millions of our products are deployed 
in the field, connecting people and  
enabling device mobility across the globe. 
From product concept to final shipment, 
our quality systems ensure that every 
component we deliver is of the highest 
quality and reliability while supporting 
environmental sustainability.
